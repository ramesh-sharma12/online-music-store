Of course, thanks to Miles J and all of M.J S.K M.M J.D\u2026 in times like these, thank goodness we have music.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, thanks once again to you for downloading & listening. We always strive to deliver the music you\u2019ll love. Please spread the word about blocSonic, if you enjoy what we do. Remember\u2026 everything we release is cool to share!

First-off, it looks brilliant, the layout reminds me of a Born Against\/(Young Pioneers) insert. Musically, the songs kinda hold that early nineties Jawbreaker, Crimpshrine style while still sounding current... loads of bass fills and gang vocals. The songs really vary within that overall boundary, which keeps the album fresh, interesting and very replayable. It's an exciting communal effort that has something to say, and there's at least a dozen people listed as contributors.

I think he is incredible composer. Some of his tracks can tell me about other worlds. About a year and half ago I suggested to Jared to record his song \"Is This The End?\" and he agreed. The song is from the album \"Between Equinox\" that was released on Happy Puppy Records in Canada in the fall of 2012.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>In the description of the album it was described as \"collection of humanly-impossible-to-play compositions\" For me, the recording process was difficult, but not impossible. After some time the song was ready.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Jared was very impressed and surprised by the fact that I did it.\u201d- Evgeniy Gerasimchuk <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\"><strong>Facebook-<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/solophein.darsian?__mref=message_bubble\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/solophein.darsian<\/span><\/a> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\"><strong>Youtube<\/strong>- <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCEXXaqoLhmOCAX_hiDxqxSQ\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCEXXaqoLhmOCAX_hiDxqxSQ<\/span><\/a> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\"><strong>Website-<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/vk.com\/zoltanhagg\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">https:\/\/vk.com\/zoltanhagg<\/span><\/a> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\"><strong>Skype-<\/strong> zoltan.hagg<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\"><strong>Composer-<\/strong> Jared C.

The two songs he wanted to play were some of the more difficult ones to perform.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I tried to convince and suggested to him a few times over the first few month of talking of performing other songs.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>He persistently REFUSED.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Once I realized he was not going to budge. I told him to start off with the easier of the two songs \u201cIs This The End?\u201d. Over the last several months, we have been working periodically via video Skype, e-mail and Facebook on the two songs.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>To my surprise and sheer excitement, he completed the first song \u201cIs This The End?\u201d.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I have been approached several times by musicians that were interested in performing one of my compositions.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>To my knowledge\/assumptions, that these musicians have never completed any of my compositions.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>So, I would have to say that Evgeniy is the first known musician to completely perform and record one of my compositions.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>He made one of my dreams come true.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>It would be great if this was first of many to be performed\/recorded\u201d- Jared C.

ONLY!<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These are very early demo recordings from 1994.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Mostly improvisational rehearsal recordings with improved overdubs.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Very messy and sloppy, though being a purest I included them for those people involved and for those with loads of time to kill and limited hearing loss.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When KG first started playing it was just Matt Icklan on drums and myself (Hellfire) on everything else.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>These early improves and rehearsals were used to get a sense of what the songs were sounding like outside of our heads and an experiment in writing, recording and overdubbing.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I came from an IMPROVE school of song writing and before this band seldom worked out anything. Naturally my first attempts were to just hit record and see what wanted to come out.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Many of the early sessions were just stop and start riff and noise with a peak; a song would 'emerge' on its own.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>It would fall apart, stop and start, change into a new song, get silly or have a moment of clarity...for a noise song.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Some of the overdub bits had very interesting sound quality though not always the best or most interesting playing.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I improved most the vocals and lyrics too...which the end result is often cringe worthy...<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Sometimes a sloppy live recording would really come together when the overdubs were applied and then we would start playing the song in rehearsals and eventually add to the live band and future recordings.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am mostly happy to include these on line for the few people who used to listen to these demos at my house and of course for Matt who probably hasn't heard these since the end of the '90's.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">'Looks like a guts to me' was a phrase from an interview with Missing Foundation rehearsal space landlord who believed he found a glass jar containing visceral material inside the ransacked space.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>This was part of the news mini-series 'cult of fear' which coincided with the skinhead news specials on or about the same week in 1989.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR

The work in this\nshow was selected from Krol's ongoing series of collages constructed\nout of Nat Sherman cigarette boxes, as well as small paintings on wood\npanels. In his contribution to the exhibition, Pat Gubler contributed\nseven pieces consisting primarily of folk harp and electronic\nprocessing played on a loop within the space of the gallery. These\npieces explore the sonic possibilities of the wire-strung harp and its\nlong sustaining tones, as well as the bray harp's sitar-like buzzing.\nBut unlike his previous song-based releases, <i>Music for the Sherman Box Series and other works<\/i>\nexclusively showcases P.G. Six's training in modern composition,\nespecially his unique blending of twentieth-century minimalism and more\ntraditional folk-techniques.\n<\/p><p>In addition to the work Pat composed in conjunction with Krol's\npieces, this CD also includes \"The Book of Rayguns\" which marked P.G.\nSix's solo-debut, a piece for six electric guitars that dates from 1994\nand which was originally released as a seven-inch single on the Tower\nRecordings' imprint, Superlux Records in 1995. This piece and the\nalbum's final selection, \"Cartographies for Piano,\" are a result of\nPat's studies with composer Dary John Mizelle at SUNY Purchase in the\nearly 90s.\n<\/p><p>- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amishrecords.com\/\">Amish Records<\/a><br \/><\/p>","album_date_released":"9\/26\/2006","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"716","album_date_created":"4\/02\/2010 01:01:37 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/PG_Six_-_3_for_Bray_Harp_-_20100405230603110.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"7415","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"6013","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/PG_Six_-_3_for_Bray_Harp_-_20100405230603110.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":"P.G.

Similarly, here is a 237-secong-long compilation of track numbers 3 to 9 from \u2018Percussion\u2019 As Percussion. Two pages are (erroneously?) not referred to by the index: Page 41\/0:41: \u201c...will seem less strange, perhaps even delightfully uncanny. I believe that the current intellectual conjuncture is such that we can no longer be satisfied with cajoling the public into better appreciating musical culture - or, for that matter, with having more of our colleagues in the humanities pick up, or return to, instruments. Though it may seem cryptic to put it this way, I think that instead we want to involve ourselves in doing what will be necessary to begin hearing the theorizing that takes place when we \u201ctympanize\u201d disciplinary reason. Walter Kauffman was surely right to remind us that Nietzsche\u2019s \u201chammer\u201d was, among other things, a tuning (pitch?) fork.\u00a0 These ill-tempered (though not therefore ill-considered) remarks prompt a final conciliatory gesture. The difficulties to be encountered in reading this text are not the result of my lack of consideration for the reader - my lack of skill, certainly, but not lack of consideration. On the contrary. These difficulties arise from the struggle to consider, and to consider thoughtfully, how one might actually mime that which one\u2019s writing seeks to illuminate - in this case, the reciprocal solicitations of music and theory as they blare from early rock-and-roll. \u201cDifficult Listening Hour,\u201d perhaps. Much depends on whether one \u201cplays it too darn fast.\u201d But if the room starts reelin\u2019 and rockin\u2019, remember: That\u2019s not a bad thing. That\u2019s the point.\u201d Page 208\/3:28: [Blank]. 12.

This could appear to be a shocking critique of Hearing Ends In Darkness?\u00a0 Darkness and \u201cbumps in the night\u201d that create a fissure in the strata of meaning!\u00a0 The work not as\u00a0 sediment\u00a0 or\u00a0 \u2018split\u2019 which\u00a0 opens\u00a0 a geological record. \u201cThe death of the author, the death of god, the death of Marxism & the end of time?\u201d In the morphology of \u201cart\u201d (under erasure)\u00a0 we trace the increasing metamorphism of \u201cnow\u201d. The force de frappe is no longer immanent \u2013 but\u00a0 present and removed - Percussion is a history lesson. Bishop Berkley\u2019s \u201cnote\u201d in history and the incident with Sam Johnson \u2013 a \u201cfoot\u201d note, the academic\u2019s scoring of rocks,\u00a0 Mohs scale,\u00a0 the note played by the foot?\u00a0 Or in the case of Ginger Baker \u2013 feet!\u00a0 History folded and distorted, metamorphosed, inclined, cut through, inscribed by hitting and writing.\u00a0 Percussion as memory- the sedimentation of the\u00a0 Weltanwesenheit both geological\u00a0 and\u00a0 ethnographical as in the tells of Troy and Nineveh, the problematic inscription \u2013 IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM \u2013\u00a0 the written constitution of an American democracy \u2013 crossed out \u2013 the pipe and drum of revolution, the inscription of an atheist creed and regicide. Do Fowler & Mowitt speak as part of this sedimentation or do they like\u00a0 Johnson refute by kicking? In every bar in Europe an LCD screen is showing what I need to call soccer- something that Umberto Eco thought wrong. What is wrong with kicking?\u00a0 Sam Johnson the great writer kicked an idea out of play. He kicked the bucket. (cockney rhyming slang?) The history of Sade,\u00a0 the acts of inscription on the naked bodies of women,\u00a0 the feminists inscription on the Velasquez nude, the slap on the backsides of Courbet\u2019s nudes. Hitting, percussion is the source of the world, the transgression of the bi-sexuality of human nature.\u00a0 So, Fowler & Mowitt speak \u2013 write \u2013 inscribe \u2013 both in and out of history. That\u2019s not so radical,\u00a0 radicalism is now at the centre, naked not nude, logical not rhetorical. Bruce Andrews in his liner notes makes some excellent points, he lays down theory \u2013I\u2019m not opposed to this \u2013 I am no longer concerned with strata and stratification, yet doomed by the inevitable process other than by virtue of perhaps a misspelling \u2013 something I was naturally \u201cgood\u201d at \u2013 \u2018Percussion\u2019 As Percusion! James Whitehead\u00a0\u00a0 august 2007 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hearing ends in darkness For Jarrod Fowler & for John Mowitt; let me spin out some categories from thinking about experimental literature \u2014 to see how they sound when rubbed up against radical \u2018percussion as percussion\u2019. What would a language writing as radical percussion sound like?\u00a0 What kind of space does it occupy \u2014 or call out for? The issues involved might hug some trajectories both of contemporary theory and of contemporary experimental writing. First, we dethrone the originating \u2018subject\u2019 \u2014 leaving the author\/performer unseated.\u00a0 No longer \u2018sovereign\u2019.\u00a0 The (sound) text no longer \u2018autonomous\u2019.\u00a0 No longer an \u2018inner\u2019 authority worth reproducing in our reception. Once we dethrone the performer\/author, they can no longer translate or \u2018explain\u2019 the making of sense & meaning & value \u2014 or at least not all by themselves.\u00a0 We listen for a shift from inner to outer:\u00a0 toward an emphasis on a pragmatic dimension \u2014 toward the listener, the beholder, the reader.\u00a0 [Here I\u2019ll conflate all these into what I\u2019ll call the Reader.] [In the political economy, this parallels an awareness of a shift in emphasis from Production to Consumption.\u00a0 (Or an understanding of how crucial the social relations of consumption must be to the shape or interpretation of production & to its success or fragility in the \u2018moshpit\u2019 of meaning.)\u00a0 As these shifts get articulated after the 1960s, they resonate with a change in the political climate & in the political hopes which are more & more invested in the \u2018affected\u2019 community, rather than in \u2018heroic\u2019 leaders or in prefixed institutional \u2018structures\u2019 or \u2018forms\u2019 \u2018up on stage\u2019.] The key, for writing & for percussion: to see how best to involve or implicate the Reader \u2014 (& to sound out this contingent role, rather than taking it for granted or treating it like a deductive reflex of preexisting form & structure).\u00a0 \u2018Heroism\u2019 devolves to the listener\/reader.\u00a0 And the overall shift rhymes with a culture of copies, of unoriginality, of sampling\/ appropriation, of \u2018making do,\u2019 of \u2018othering\u2019. This might also remind us of a move toward participatory \u2018democracy\u2019 \u2014 away from the Author\u2019s central (sovereign) authority.\u00a0 And yet, instead of leaving a vacuum to be filled by some celebration of posthumanist machinic automatism, it takes this \u2018de-authorizing\u2019 of writing \u2014 not as an end in itself \u2014 but as an occasion to empower the Reader. But:\u00a0 what kind of Reader could be empowered?\u00a0 And what kind of textual experience is best equipped to deliver\u00a0 or make possible this Reader?\u00a0 And what kind of text or writing is best equipped to make possible a pleasurably resisant or transformative experience? We could chart the method of writing (& of the ways in which it gets experienced) across two distinct but intersecting planes: 1. Vertically, a plane of depth details the \u2018what\u2019:\u00a0 of levels of abstraction or types & degrees of reference \u2014 making a spectrum that extends, on one end, from the offering up of purely non-referential or literal matter through a middle zone in which there is an engagement with (generically) referential materials & then proceeds all the way, at the other end, to a variety of (expressive or depictive) representational practices.\u00a0 And then, intersecting this: 2.\u00a0 We can chart out a plane of concentric circles, configuring the pragmatic \u2018how\u2019 of operating contextually, toward the \u2018outside\u2019:\u00a0 of soliciting a Reader in a variety of contextual ways.\u00a0 This extends outward from a boundaried & centripetal \u2018center\u2019 of Formalizing Autonomy, to an outer \u2018layer\u2019 where the space of a basic (or generic) Reader does get engaged, and then extending further out into the \u2018play\u2019 made possible in an even more discursive & more broadly social arena.\u00a0 It\u2019s this second plane, or series of concentric spaces, that I want to elaborate on a little bit here.\u00a0 What is a work \u2018subject to\u2019?\u00a0 The key question would be how a work alters the contextual space outside \u2014 & how the contextual space allows for an expansive Reader.\u00a0 Openness \u2014 the press on the how.\u00a0 If there is an act, let\u2019s imagine it as the Reader\u2019s, not something accomplished on the part of the writing \u2018all by itself\u2019; with the Reader as \u2018functional\u2019 (& possibly collective), with contextual \u2018translation\u2019 (or totalizing) taking place on the side of\u00a0 \u2014 & not \u2018on behalf of\u2019 \u2014 the Reader. [This outer social layer or circle is occupiable by a particularized (or \u2018surplus\u2019) Reader.\u00a0 And that more socially engaged Readership itself makes up a spectrum between a fixed or static identity (or agency), at one end, to another identity which is \u2018on the move,\u2019 tilted toward (& open to) development & fluidity & transformation & change.] This would be a plane of Context or Mediation \u2014 extending from an [auratic or formal] \u2018immediacy\u2019 \u2014 & then outward toward an acknowledgement of the Reader\u2019s active mediation, & then still further toward an even more outlying discursive or social network.\u00a0 Where the authored act becomes progressively less definitive \u2014 & encourages more & more sharing of power (or empowerment). We could configure this plane of Context in three concentric circles: (A),\u00a0 A centripetal (inward-sucking) point (or \u2018inner circle\u2019) of formalistic closure & autonomy at the center.\u00a0 And around that, extending the text outward, would be (B),\u00a0 mechanisms by which a generic (any kind of \u2014 or basic kind of) Reader would be engaged by a certain kind of text noticeably venturing out into that Reader\u2019s actual physical (or \u2018real\u2019) space.\u00a0 Gaps solicit a contextual space by allowing or requiring a Reader response.\u00a0 So, for instance, if the material\/materiality is shredded, torn up, \u2018volatilized,\u2019 it moves it further away from formalizable autonomy on this plane.\u00a0\u00a0 And, even more extendedly, (C), we find the text engaging\u00a0 (often by transformationally working on) a set of discursive or social meanings (or elements of sense-making) so that we find an even more outreaching layer or concentric circle where \u2018participants\u2019 of a less generic & more particularized sort are capable of being engaged \u2014 with the very sorts of discursive meaning that distinguish them, that particularize them. All this makes up a contextual plane. This suggests a charting of the uncloseable, the unformable \u2018in itself,\u2019 the move towards an \u201cinformalism\u201d where the Reader is doing the work & is given responsibility for the \u2018forming\u2019.\u00a0 This plane amounts to an exchange, a map of transactions between inner & outer.\u00a0 Context involves the types of space created for the Reader, the degree & type of \u2018Intrusion\u2019 involved in Reception \u2014 the types of Interpellation & the type of Resistance made available (or at least the ways of foiling or skirting or distorting that Interpellation). Interpellation, famous from Althusser\u2019s essay, \u201cIdeology and Ideological State Apparatuses\u201d & from its wielding by cultural theorists, points to a mode of address or hailing that effectively positions the listener \u2014 or at least reinforces\u00a0 & stabilizes their positioning.\u00a0 You are out walking in the street.\u00a0 Someone calls out behind you, \u201cYo!, Shithead!\u201d\u00a0 By swivelling around, you acknowledge that you are (or certainly at least might be) the appropriate, fitting \u2018subject\u2019 of that address.\u00a0 And the acknowledgement \u2014 as a recognition \u2014 helps to create or upholster a space for you to occupy, a position to\u00a0 identify with, to take up \u2018subjective residence\u2019\u2014 transforming the listener into a subject, with a merely or basically physical 180 degree conversion.\u00a0 Closure \u2014 the predetermining of the what, linked with recognition.\u00a0 Recruitment \u2014 the hegemony of the what over the how.\u00a0 When is it more than mythification? For each of these three concentric circles or arenas: First, we can ask how each articulates a different mode by which the interpellation of the Reader (or listener) would be affirmed \/ confirmed \/ reassured \/ guaranteed.\u00a0 And, second, we can ask how experimental writing (or sound) could help resist \/ transgress \/ unsettle \/ distantiate \/ undercut such a mode of Interpellation. And each of these three arenas of contextualization could be elaborated a little further, by assigning to each a type of sign, an element of textuality, & a characteristic type of Reader. A. First, the \u2018inward pull\u2019 or internal logic of Form \u2014 as Closure, as Autonomy, as if unmediated.\u00a0 The \u2018for itself\u2019 & the \u2018in itself,\u2019 that which doesn\u2019t need to be \u2018actualized\u2019 \u2014 form, the formable, as the directive, as the closure-able. Creating a unifiable gestalt \u2014 as the \u2018already\u2019.\u00a0 To pull the Reader in, & by doing so, to function as if the contagions of everyday reality [context] can be held at arm\u2019s length \u2014 with the art\u2019s formal properties working as anaesthesia or bandage [but also as lure]. The equivalent of a sign of the icon type (where the sign physically resembles either the referent or object\u2019s properties or else is an analog of its organizing principles). [And possibly comes to physically \u2018resemble\u2019 the Reader, through its characteristic style of Interpellation.\u00a0 The iconicized reader.\u00a0 We would resemble pictures or maps \u2014 images or diagrams \u2014 modelled on the text.\u00a0 A work\u2019s \u2018authority\u2019 becomes our mimesis.] The Reader choreographed here is a kind of pre-reader, or pre-subject (a self or individual not yet equipped with full, discriminating agency & choice-making; an imprint, often where potential agency is getting overwhelmed).\u00a0 As if \u2018the Possible\u2019 were anonymous \u2014 or virtual \u2014 as if unperceived or at least not constituted by perception \u2014 unmediated, uncoded, as if without much need at all for any intervening receiver. [Some parallel here to the Lacanian realm of the Imaginary.\u00a0 And to Charles Peirce\u2019s \u2018Firstness,\u2019 where the \u201cmere may-be\u201d functions as an array of possibilities in all its \u2018freshness,\u2019 unselected\/unmotivated by any pragmatic interest.] Element of language involved = the \u2018already read\u2019, the not-to-be-read, or the \u2018doesn\u2019t need to be read\u2019. \u00a0hearing ends in darkness iv \u00a0hearing ends in darkness ii iii \u2018percussion\u2019 as percussion MAGENTA\u00a0 CYAN YELLOW\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BLACK Page 3 Page 2 Page 8 Page 1sales rep: 1st ofa date: artist: cust: control: job #: rel #: Safety margin Bleed line CD800P 8 Page Poster-Inside indd1\/14\/02 The characteristic mode of Interpellation here suggests a soothing or deadening or hypnotic positioning.\u00a0 The fix is in. [Paralleling either the dreaded regressive \u2018unit of the mass\u2019 (like the victim of spectacle), or perhaps the swooning absorbed- into-presence of the contemplative subject.\u00a0 As unchoice, or mimesis of the listener \u2014 modelled on \u2018Authority\u2019.] In whatever version, fittingly, we expect to find a non-Reader \u2014 captivated by a closed, formally complete product of art- making. And if we want to counter (or counteract) this Interpellation, a progressive project would very likely involve a de-forming, a move toward\u00a0 (or a stress on) incompleteness, a rejection of closure, an acknowledgement of the contextual elements calling out for active engagement (yet adverse to hypnosis). [This de-forming could open up opportunities for either a fixed\/static Reader, or a moving Reader (the dancing Reader, the Reader \u2018on the move\u2019) to emerge, minimally individuated, differentiated out from the mass, pulled into focus as if by centrifuge.]\u00a0 With that challenge to Interpellation, we approximate what happens in a second, more extended layer. B. One concentric zone outward on this plane: the text, or the sound, more pointedly involved in address, extends itself into the existing territory of a generic Reader, fashioning a determinate (durational) space.\u00a0 Here we get beyond the detemporalizing \u2018all at once\u2019 of iconic (autonomizing) reception. Readership gets engaged by a more physicalized interaction \u2014 the offering up of materials that can be read or interpreted [& thus re-read]:\u00a0 ones that depend upon the playing or engagement of the Reader for their full[er] significance to register (or be experienced). An art less already unified into a finished form or gestalt that preexists (& seems not to depend upon) the Reader. Something which suggests a causal relationship between sign & referent (or object):\u00a0 the equivalent of a sign of the index kind \u2014 where the sign could register a physical trace of the referent, like a clue or symptom \u2014 with some coercive control over the Reader.\u00a0 Here we find the press of documentary evidence, rather than the distancing aura of \u2018logic\u2019: with the index \u2014 either connected to an object by some factual relation or by \u2018forcibly intruding,\u2019 whether it gets interpreted or not. [And where the Reader might suggest a physical trace of the sign \u2014 where the recruited are \u2018called out\u2019 & \u2018forced to correspond\u2019.\u00a0 The indexicalized reader:\u00a0 index as Reader; Reader as a predicate.\u00a0 Impact = to be \u2018moved\u2019.\u00a0 Readers as clues or symptoms partially caused by the work.\u00a0 Text\u2019s \u2018power\u2019 as measured by its (mediated) impact on the Reader.] The Reader being engaged or reinforced here seems like a more abstract (phenomenological) sort \u2014 equipped with a certain agency & capacity for choice & identification, but where this\u00a0 still remains at a basic, generic (or unparticularized) level. [Some parallel here to the Lacanian realm of the Real.\u00a0 And to the documentary; to Peirce\u2019s reactive, perceptual \u2018Secondness\u2019:\u00a0 inducements of movement, the realm of \u2018brute facts\u2019.] Element of language involved = Syntax.\u00a0 Mostly.\u00a0 A syntax of generic individuals gets called for (or hailed) \u2014 to mark out the abstract functioning of a language:\u00a0 as minimally readable or decipherable, but without much in the way of non-abstract or particularized meaning (or \u2018use\u2019).\u00a0 [Almost as if we\u2019re back to Marx\u2019s Theses on Feurbach & the notion of an \u201cabstract \u2014 isolated \u2014 human individual\u201d (as distinct from the socialized, unisolated, \u2018real\u2019 individual).]\u00a0 A parsing: a marking out of slots & functions, capable of being occupied by \u2018any\u2019 subject.\u00a0 [And percussion often fits here.\u00a0 It tends to register too intrusively to be tameable by any formalizing autonomy.\u00a0 It tends at least to carry an indexical punch.] Here, the mode of Interpellation suggests a physical harnessing of the permitted Reader:\u00a0 the soliciting of some expansive movement, the creating of some space for movement, but without undercutting the \u2018security\u2019 of a generic position.\u00a0 The interpellated subject \u2014 as generic Reader \u2014 precedes any particularized prompting, any specific identity.\u00a0 The index makes the specific \u2014 to finetune into specificity; the generic position capable of making specific assertions or \u2018reading\u2019 \u201cspecific objects\u201d.\u00a0 And the Reader is prompted to link up resonances much like a detective\u2019s discovery of clues or the doctor\u2019s \u2018reading\u2019 of symptoms to work up a diagnosis. The text offers a \u2018beating\u2019.\u00a0 It hammers the Reader into a trajectory (much like the premodern space of fear & punishment) \u2014 [as in Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish] \u2014 but at least the distances are not insurmountable:\u00a0 there\u2019s some space to be affected, to be opened up. What could enable the \u2018fencing moves\u2019 of a Reader, on the borderline between inner & outer? How could it ward off excess stimuli & carve out some space?\u00a0 To counteract this Interpellation, the generic Reader would need to be offered a filter, a protective shielding \u2014 by some way in which the work could be felt to undercut itself.\u00a0 To solicit the Reader\u2019s \u2018cutting\u2019.\u00a0 The \u2018heroic\u2019 Reader or reading listener would be osmotic:\u00a0 not \u2018swept away\u2019 by the text, yet also not impermeable \u2014 more like an \u2018organ\u2019 of the threshold regulating the intake, as if a controlled leakage or exchange (rather than \u2018free trade\u2019). The clues need to be \u2018read\u2019 backwards; they need to be explained \u2014 reading as translation, requiring some inference or interpretation of what\u2019s missing or equivocal:\u00a0 as a way to limit any imposition of a fixed, unambiguous syntax; some shift toward the use of materials which have the kind of ambiguity or openness (even if only openness to prior prejudice!) that we find approximated in the third, more extended concentric band or layer: C. A discursive or social \u2018outer\u2019 layer \u2014 where the work (the text) engages a less generic Reader (extending itself into the particularized territory of meaning or sense that we associate with the discursive elements of a text rhythmically activated with socially loaded materials). Right away, the autonomy & closure of the distanced aesthetic object or icon gets sharply undermined.\u00a0 And so does the \u2018merely\u2019 physical (if more open) operation of a generic sign or index, in its status as a \u2018pre-cultural\u2019 event. Here we\u2019re engaging a particularized Reader with a set of cultural materials (of varying degrees of recognizability or familiarity).\u00a0 We move outward from the generic subject to a particular identity, a particularized Reader capable of making general assertions.\u00a0 The Reder is no longer merely \u2018a\u2019 subject, but becomes \u201ctendentious,\u201d the respondee with a particular agenda.\u00a0 So that the work\u2019s meaning operates on the same plane or in the same arena as the socialized subject who is capable of cultural engagement:\u00a0 to produce a work that depends upon that actual (non-generic) Reader for its significance to get experienced. The aesthetic transaction takes on a more audibly cultural tone. A Reader discursively engaged \u2014 & that also implies that the social materials will depend upon the Reader\u2019s involvement:\u00a0 for them to be validated, reinforced, or contested.\u00a0 There is no \u2018finished\u2019 discourse; no \u2018complete\u2019 rendition of a social body. With this, the sign relates to its referent (or object) in an arbitrary, conventional manner \u2014 as with the symbol.\u00a0 We operate within a conventional [rule-following] relation to the text.\u00a0 Norms [or \u201claws\u201d] provide the motivation.\u00a0 [And where the sign \u2018array\u2019 is situated in an arbitrary, conventional relationship to the Reader: plunged into a discursive pattern of resonances and overtones, it promotes additional or \u2018surplus\u2019 meaning on the way to being conventionalized or arbitrated.\u00a0 As if an argument is getting made.] Here, the Reader who is (partially, repetitively) solicited or positioned is no longer \u2018bare\u2019 or \u2018basic\u2019 or generic.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s particularized, expected to have distinguishing features, adjectival modifiers\u2014 & to be engaged in cultural choices on the basis of those distinguishing aspects.\u00a0 The experience is interpretive & not merely literal or perceptual. (Meanwhile, the more particularized the identity, the more that can threaten the reproduction of those particularized non- generic features \u2014 & the more that has to get arranged to secure or guarantee them:\u00a0 hence, we are likely to find an even more expansive motivation or \u2018security regime\u2019 on the part of the Reader.) [Some parallel here to the Lacanian realm of the Symbolic.\u00a0 And to Peirce\u2019s relation or lawful or action-oriented \u2018Thirdness\u2019] Element of language involved = Content.\u00a0 (Semantic sense, social sense) The slots & functions are now fine-tuned socially or culturally \u2014 are layered choices, no longer \u2018one size fits all\u2019 (even for a seemingly \u2018radical\u2019 project). [The matrix of associations is loaded.\u00a0 The Reader is the content.] The mode of Interpellation \u2014 as a fixing theorem: not to reveal the unfinished, the problematic \u2014 suggests a pointedly social recruitment, where the space for the Reader to be affected, to be \u2018open,\u2019 is being shaped into a directively disciplinary space \u2014 as Influence on our choices, our sovereignty.\u00a0 Discourse as contractual; discursive \u2018recruitment\u2019 as differential or relational; discourse as a sign system tapped into. \u00a0A space of self-discipline, a summons to normalized or domesticated choices, to social identifications (& often \u2018pride,\u2019 with appropriate gang tags or colors or puffed-up claims of \u2018I did it my way\u2019). Not a \u2018beating\u2019 \u2018from the outside,\u2019 but often a self-coordinated & well-practiced dancing routine: or reading as sychronized accompaniment. To counteract this kind of Interpellation, to create a space for resistance, we would shape the work to take advantage of the fact that cultural recruitment isn\u2019t typically unified.\u00a0 The accompaniment is wayward, unpredictable, or re-chartable with a different \u2018fake book\u2019. That any fixed Reader identity (or agency) can be unsettled, discombobulated \u2014 not \u2018all at once\u2019 in some traumatic wounding or redemption, but as a accompaniment, or backbeat, or background noise, to a commitment to change.\u00a0 The move is away from the (even grammatically marked out) isolation & relative autonomy of individuals \u2014 to a possible collective future via [informalist] connections.\u00a0 A receptive subject which can be connectable, \u2018politicizable,\u2019 open to any number of collective projects \u2014\u00a0 not just the \u2018mass\u2019 demonized by genteel opinion.\u00a0 What\u2019s worth resisting \u2014 figuring out a strategy for resisting \u2014 are either an recruitment into preset identity\u00a0 or regression into a collective mass-like object.\u00a0 Collective listenership:\u00a0 the connections are forged in just the same way as they are between the cultural inflections of sounds & sound mixes.\u00a0 They are not imposed ahead of time \u2014 [\u201cahead of time\u201d: a telling phrase].\u00a0 The process could play out in two stages:\u00a0 first, a heightened awareness of distinguishing cuts (instead of any suturing or confirmation of\u00a0 predetermined, precomposed identity); & second, a revved-up move toward connections.\u00a0 First, a mixdown into a complexly layered set of [motivic] raw materials; second, the highlighting of links & hybridities & interdependencies between these subject positions or motivations, pointing toward possible collective identities.\u00a0 To \u2018cohere\u2019 the particularized Readers into an active chorus, responding, filling in gaps, leaping the intervals\/layers. In the field of Interpellation, there are gaps; there are contradictions which a text can take advantage of. Sounds are unsound.\u00a0 The individual isn\u2019t unified.\u00a0 Interpellative effects are not unified.\u00a0 There is rarely if ever an umbrella of a unified ideology.\u00a0 Agency as social resistance would be made possible in part by the dissonance in & among the various subject positions made more available (& by which a Reader could be \u2018called by\u2019). There is a social\/cultural \u2018collage\u2019 quality to the \u2018content,\u2019 to the address activated by a discursively-saturated work like this.\u00a0 Not the individual as a presumed plenitude, complete & singular & coherent in itself, but as a lamination, a less predictable collage.\u00a0 (And relevant to so much radical art & music & writing:\u00a0 the layered & multiple resonance summons up a characteristically urban space.\u00a0 Urban multiplex circumstances project some of their own energy & structure back into the writing\/reading.) This is one thing that makes possible a Reader \u2018on the move\u2019 \u2014 \u2018in process\u2019 socially (& not just according to some abstract generic schema).\u00a0 The \u2018backbeat\u2019 as the Reader retranslating, as a socially contestable resounding or\u00a0 reflection upon itself. A Reader encouraged to beat back, to reject or reconsider or reinterpret; to reassemble a life of choices \u2014 including the choice of willful distortion, of \u2018creative falsification,\u2019 of\u00a0 overlayering, of dissonance, of noise.\u00a0 Of conceptual percussion as social repercussion.

of the brass in his cello concerto, although only on a referential basis because not as much could be accomplished. but what i was really interested into was getting random fragments of timbrical-oriented thrusts and accidental mouthpiece play. to this i added spontaneous appearances of feedback generated with my own audio interface and a recording of a destroyed piano artist araceli

I've played one myself, so this is a thorny relationship, but in pop and \"rock\" music i often want to silence the guitarist, especially solos (I often feel the same about sax players in jazz!),\u201d says Bendle, ex of late 1970s\/early 1980s post-punk outfit The Door and the Window and now one-half of the electro-acoustic, noise-folk-industrial experiment known as dustdevil &amp; crow.  \u201c And here I am playing with a guitarist - who makes this amazing noise!  I always feel honoured that such a brilliant musician wants to work on my songs!\u201d\nThat guitarist is Michael Duane, one-time leader of NYC No Wave mainstays The Dustdevils, erstwhile Wedding Present guitarist and, more recently,  a collaborator with Railroad Jerk\u2019s Steve Cerio (in psych-rocking Atlantic Drone) and Jackie-O Motherfucker.  He and Bendle have been working together as Dustdevil&amp; Crow since 2008, when they connected via a blog post Duane had made about The Door and the Window.  \nBendle contacted Duane to thank him and a musical conversation ensued, conducted, then as now, entirely over the internet.  Bendle sent Duane some solo material, including a song meant for his next album.  Duane replied, \u201cI need to play bass on this!\" and the partnership began.  \u201cInitially I'd build a bed of loops and sing a melody line over the top, and Michael would add stuff and then I would add more.   Often I'd then remove some or all of my original loops,\u201d Bendle explained.  \u201cNow the beginnings of songs come as often from Michael's end as from mine.\u201d\n Working in this way, mostly by exchanging files, but occasionally touching base by phone, Bendle and Duane created three albums together, 2009\u2019s while walking slowly you can see the grasses grow, 2010\u2019s while speaking softly you can hear the insects sing and now \u2026and chuang tzu dreamed that he was me.  The album was named for the 4th century (BC) Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu who, myth has it, once dreamed he was a butterfly and woke up wondering if he were a butterfly dreaming of being Chuang Tzu.  \nA dreamlike sense of mystery pervades the title track and, indeed, the rest of the album, in elliptical poetic lyrics and a hazy intuition of alternate realities.  Yet the songs are also fringed with rock aggression, rough-edged guitars, abrasive noise and, in two places, a drum beat reminiscent of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks.\u201d  There are clearly two very different sensibilities at work.  The way they mesh with and contradict and reinforce each other is part of the fascination.\nBendle said that he was occasionally surprised by what Duane had added to his compositions, but that the two worked from a foundation of trust.  \u201cSometimes I can't even hear a connection between [what I\u2019ve sent and what he\u2019s written] when i first listen, but I have learned that it always works,\u201d Bendle said.  \u201cAfter all, he's the musician in this band. I am maybe good at constructing music, but have limited capacities for properly playing anything... after many years of on\/off performing and recording music I am still a non-musician.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cI\u2019m also always amazed that Michael accepts my processing and sometimes mangling of what he does. For example \u2018November\u2019 began as a guitar duet from the same session, and having the same kind of sound as,\u2019Fritz Haber\u2019... and I turned it into something rather different! And even on \u201cFritz Haber\u2019, i took the original guitar parts and cut and spliced them in a way that I felt worked for the song.\u201d\n\u2026and chuang tzu dreamed that he was me, as well as the two earlier dustdevil&amp; crow albums, can be purchased via http:\/\/bendle.bandcamp.com\n\nFor all other enquires, use the contact button at the bandcamp site above.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Jennifer Kelly\u00a0<\/p>","album_date_released":"9\/01\/2011","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"3366","album_date_created":"7\/27\/2011 12:43:55 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Dustdevil__Crow_-__and_chiang_tzu_dreamed_that_he_was_me_-_2011072703544850.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"14952","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"9698","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Dustdevil__Crow_-__and_chiang_tzu_dreamed_that_he_was_me_-_2011072703544850.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"},{"image_id":"14953","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"9698","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Dustdevil__Crow_-__and_chiang_tzu_dreamed_that_he_was_me_-_2011072703556659.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"15683","album_title":"...

The principal idea is the same: Nicolas and Simon get together,  improvise, talk, record, refine, re-improvise, and so on. Next to Simon  Trottier's imaginative and unworldly melodies, field-recordings play a  huge role. Just like \"objet\", \"f\u00f4ret\" is a highly emotional project,  with strong connections to the Quebecois countryside. All is sewn to  quicksilver beauty by Nicolas Bernier. His big talent is  contextualisation - underneath wistful and strangely remote melodies,  Nicolas mixes field-recordings, subtle synthesizers and certain  percussion elements. <br \/><br \/>Bernier mirrors Trottier like a feedback.  Eventually, and this is the biggest strength of \"... et retrouv\u00e9 en  f\u00f4ret\", improvisations and drones become songs again.

Thinking them turning a bit polite, The Vocokesh          provided the necessary vessel to sufficiently blast Franecki's undiluted          vision of full-blown experimental\/free-acid rock mayhem further out into          the ether. Multiple recordings for RRRecords, Drag City, Lexicon          Devil (responsible for many a Vocokesh and F\/i reissue) and Strange          Attractors Audio House chart relentless trajectories of improvised,          analog electronics-laced instrumental rock psychedelics that reverently          summon the spirits of the most marginalized ruffians of 70's Krautrock          (Amon Duul I, Ash Ra Tempel, Agitation Free) while exploring newer          terrain. With 2005's <em>Through the          Smoke<\/em>, The Vocokesh took a bit of a detour by lacing          their hallucinatory flurries with actual \"songs\", in the vein of latter          60's fuzz\/psych. Franecki and the boys' restless spirit never wanes, and          thus <em>\u2026All This and Hieronymus Bosch<\/em>, The Vocokesh's          eighth release, marks more departures from previous formulas, resulting          in some of their finest and freshest sonics yet. <br \/><br \/> Synthesizers and electronics, so prominently on display throughout The          Vocokesh catalog, takes more of a backseat role while the sitar, only          sparingly used in the past, bubbles strongly to the surface. The result          lends an Eastern-tinged vibe to many of the tunes, a late 60's consciousness-elevating          cool akin to the magic carpet rides in rock 'n' roll which largely occured          post-Monterey Pop. Masterful guitar work is still in rich abundance, but          many of the dark psych passages The Vocokesh are known for is offset by          some sunnier trajectories. As implied by the title, <em>\u2026All This and          Hieronymus Bosch<\/em> hosts a surrealistic depth rarely matched in          instrumental rock these days - a fantastic entry into The Vocokesh's          ongoing psychedelic experiments. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\">-<a href=\"http:\/\/www.strange-attractors.com\/catalog\/saah048.html\">Strange Attractors<\/a><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>","album_date_released":"2\/13\/2007","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"464","album_date_created":"10\/22\/2009 07:43:31 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/The_Vocokesh_-_All_This_and_Hieronymus_Bosch_-_2009113014025899.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"3541","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Feodor_Chaliapin_-_2009113014759671.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Feodor Chaliapin","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Feodor_Chaliapin.jpg"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"8646","album_title":"...And The Demon Smiles","album_handle":"And_The_Demon_Smiles","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Carlos_Giffoni__Chuck_Bettis_DEVASTATION_DUO\/And_The_Demon_Smiles\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Carlos Giffoni & Chuck Bettis (DEVASTATION DUO)","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Carlos_Giffoni__Chuck_Bettis_DEVASTATION_DUO\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>This was a recording of the first ritual by Devastation Duo (Carlos Giffoni &amp; Chuck Bettis). \u00a0 The ritual took place on January 9, 2005 at the now defunkt space called Sin-e, whom unbeknowest to us posted and tried selling our set online without our consent. \u00a0We however had given our recording (that we did ourselves via minidisc) to Belgium's Audiobot label to release. \u00a0 Now that both label and venue are no longer, we present it to you for free. \u00a0Let it be a welcomed virus. \u00a0<\/p>","album_date_released":"1\/09\/2005","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"418","album_date_created":"2\/22\/2011 08:31:04 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Carlos_Giffoni__Chuck_Bettis_DEVASTATION_DUO_-_And_The_Demon_Smiles_-_20110222193726778.jpeg","album_images":[{"image_id":"9991","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/mackaywattestel_-_20100917124933827.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: mackay\/watt\/estel","image_caption":"l to r: andrew bushe, tommy o'sullivan, sarah sheil, mike watt + steve mackay","image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"18656","album_title":"...Are Free and Dumb","album_handle":"Are_Free_and_Dumb","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/People\/Are_Free_and_Dumb\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"People","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/People\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"All songs made up on the spot may 5th 2014 in a room in a building on a street in Austin, TX.","album_date_released":"6\/22\/2015","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"10","album_listens":"13276","album_date_created":"8\/04\/2015 05:57:02 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/People_-_Are_Free_and_Dumb_-_20150804182126503.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"27448","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Konstantin_Zed_-_20140607125023202.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"21214","album_title":"...est\u00e9ticas de la siesta.","album_handle":"estticas_de_la_siesta","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/liars\/estticas_de_la_siesta\/","album_type":"Single Tracks","artist_name":"M'Other","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/liars\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Tema grabado en Infra Sonic Unit, Francia el 31 marzo de 2012.

With an oeuvre that sounds like a more dance friendly and mentally disabled version of Ariel Pink, the trio (live often extended by the guitarist of Iceage) is ready to herald a new musical era. Fusion jazz, Alan Vega and eighties AOR are the main ingredients of the Girlseeker cult and despite the sometimes happy sounding keyboard patterns, the lyrics embrace the same existentialist crisis of that period. With the whole electronic eighties revival movement Girlseeker share a fascination for MTV- and VHS culture, but leaves out all the irony and false nostalgia. This is pop music in its purest moment: psychotic outsider art for the romantic listener.<\/p>\n<p style=\"vertical-align:baseline;background-color:transparent;list-style-type:none;border-width:0px;padding:0px;margin:0px;\">This LP is a split-release with Big Love, Insula Music, Release the Bats, Denim Hologram, Silver Ghosts, KRAAK, New Images, Music City, 4:2:2v2 en Underwater Peoples.<\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"2951","album_date_created":"4\/26\/2012 11:07:14 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Girlseeker_-_1-800-GREED_-_20120426110301426.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"18743","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"11562","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Girlseeker_-_1-800-GREED_-_20120426110301426.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 1-800-GREED","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"6987","album_title":"1.

Here he puts together an all Czech version of Koonda Holaa and for the next 16 months of relentless touring and shameless credit card debt, he met and collaborates with the new blood; projects with Radon collective, Steve Mackay, Hutch Hutchinson and Dave Catching at the Rancho, usaisamonster, bastard noise and amps for christ remain the most memorable ones.<\/p><p>The latest release \"Sad and Sobbing Songs of Jameel abdul Kebab is a gem dug out in the San Bernardino mountains -new home of Track Brack recording studio. Almost entirely recorded off grid and assisted by Henry Barnes and his amazing collection of self made instruments.<\/p><p>Kamilsky no longer wears his electronics as his coat - it\u2019s all a clean, crisp affair, but the humor and unusual sound remains constant in this album of mystical western balladering. The new band consists of Chante Brown from Philadelphia's heavy metal band Roullete and the French half of Sikhara, Yaan Geffraud. Live shows will be presented with projections of movies made with or by Kamilsky and other work from his favorite VJ's and directors.<\/p>","album_date_released":"3\/29\/2009","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"8","album_tracks":"8","album_listens":"12371","album_date_created":"5\/06\/2009 01:09:46 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Koonda_Holaa_-_10_Acres_of_the_Finest_Sand_-_2009113012911225.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"14500","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Angels_in_America_-_20110703231100194.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null},{"image_id":"7115","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Angels_in_America_-_20100314234356633.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":["radon"]},{"album_id":"11176","album_title":"10 anos tocando pr@s amig@s","album_handle":"10_anos_tocando_prs_amigs","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Retrigger\/10_anos_tocando_prs_amigs\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Retrigger","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Retrigger\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"3921","album_date_created":"2\/27\/2012 07:58:18 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Retrigger_-_10_anos_tocando_prs_amigs_-_20120227191439071.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"14251","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Luck_One_-_20110620130415041.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":"Live at KEXP","image_copyright":"KEXP-Morgen Schuler All Rights Reserved","image_source":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/kexp\/5178141622\/in\/set-72157625389568634\/"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"4678","album_title":"10 Minutes","album_handle":"10_Minutes","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Cleft\/10_Minutes\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Cleft","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Cleft\/","album_producer":"Sven","album_engineer":"Cleft","album_information":"<p>allow yourself 10 minutes of mental wellness.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>an excerpt of this album has been released earlier this year on this stunning compilation: <a title=\"Wakka chikka wakka chikka volume 2\" href=\"\/music\/WM_Recordings_Various_Artists\/Wakka_chikka_wakka_chikka_Porn_music_for_the_masses_volume_2\/\">Wakka chikka wakka chikka volume 2<\/a><\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"957","album_date_created":"11\/13\/2009 04:20:32 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Cleft_-_10_Minutes_-_2009113012142307.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"4967","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"4678","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Cleft_-_10_Minutes_-_2009113012142307.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 10 Minutes","image_caption":"cleft - 10 minutes","image_copyright":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/","image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"12275","album_title":"10 songs of 28 years","album_handle":"11_songs_of_28_years","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Stephan_Siebert\/11_songs_of_28_years\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Stephan Siebert","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Stephan_Siebert\/","album_producer":"st.siebert","album_engineer":"flo","album_information":"<p>electric\/acoustic jazz<\/p>","album_date_released":"4\/15\/2011","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"13","album_listens":"23653","album_date_created":"8\/09\/2012 05:03:00 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Stephan_Siebert_-_11_songs_of_28_years_-_20120809112905847.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"16488","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Alison_Knowles_-_2011111703610203.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Alison Knowles","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"4633","album_title":"10 Years of Future Roots Radio","album_handle":"10_Years_of_Future_Roots_Radio","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/dublab\/10_Years_of_Future_Roots_Radio\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"dublab","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/dublab\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><b>dublab is celebrating 10 years of turning you on!<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Throughout this decade, we've been fortunate enough to have some of\nour favorite creative friends record live sets at our studio in Los\nAngeles.

in China, on a Nokia mobile phone composer tool. <br \/><br \/>Cin Cin Man was COPYRIGHTED and promptly COPYLEFTED (anybody is free to use it, improve, change, mutilate, but with NO commercial purposes). <br \/><br \/>The IDEA is to create a project where 1000 COVERS of \"Cin Cin Man\" song will be composed and published. <br \/><br \/>PREPARATIONS were initiated from the collection and coordination centre in Amsterdam. <br \/><br \/>Covers range in style from ring tones to pop songs, classical composition, opera, jazz, muzak, country and western, Zulu, bossa nova, rock, r&b, un-describable etc., all very personal and unique. <br \/><br \/>They still bear the title Cin Cin Man.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>The moment cover number 1000 arrives to the database of the coordination centre in Amsterdam, the FINAL PHASE will be initiated. <br \/><br \/>An anthology COMPILATION disc will be released with 1000 versions of Cin Cin Man. <br \/><br \/>The examples of the disc (Blue Ray Disc\/25 GB) will be donated to ESA (European Space Agency), CSA (China Space Agency) and other space agencies to be taken into deep space and released for ET (extra-terrestrials), as essential part of the COMPILATION (re)presenting artistic highlights of the once CIVILISATION from planet Earth. <br \/><br \/>For now 12 versions are available from WM Recordings.<br \/><br \/>Related website: <a

Several of the songs are inspired by the film The Night Porter (1976). The live event itself was called \"Music on Dark Screens.\" St-Onge's dark, minimal and lush double bass is a perfect compliment to Geller's unconventional and minimal song structures. The songs and sounds refract each element together like an interplay between cracked and broken mirrors. The lyrics to the songs, like the film, make explicit that the violence of political reality interweaves with emotional, personal and psychic life, demonstrating the total inseparability of the world and self and sexuality. Recommended for people who saturate and submerge themselves in their listening.

with open mind, letting whatever happens to happen. That said, this offering is quite different from the previous release - the recorded melodies, improvised using synths, guitars and effect pedals, were trimmed from meaningless meanderings and the most lyrical, trancelike repetitions were chosen and then meticulously layered atop one another in order to create bigger, sparkling wholes. However, apart from layering, no further processing was done post-recording.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">The result is \"2 (Blue)\". Often not sounding improvised at all, due to the melodical motifs developing gradually and being repeated to achieve hypnotic effects. Reverbing walls of guitars, blurry or sharp clear synth melodies flowing and intertwining, bubbling and gurgling effects combine into a pleasant, if often bordering on noisy, hallucinogenic sound trip.<\/span><\/p>","album_date_released":"1\/01\/2013","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"2256","album_date_created":"6\/26\/2013 05:32:04 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Everywhere_Kingdom_-_2_Blue_-_20130626173059244.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"20758","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Grafvolluth_-_20121016152856485.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Grafvolluth","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":"Grafvolluth","image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"14167","album_title":"2 Digitizdat: The Circumvention of Populace Censure","album_handle":"Magnitizdat_Escaping_the_Censorship_of_the_Dollar","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/U_Can_Unlearn_Guitar\/Magnitizdat_Escaping_the_Censorship_of_the_Dollar\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"U Can Unlearn Guitar","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/U_Can_Unlearn_Guitar\/","album_producer":"Dr. Juan","album_engineer":"Toot Toot!

Nonetheless opposed to feeling like I had control, playing around, being more in a searching-mode also had its charm :) .\u00a0Gear used on these;\u00a0Computer;\u00a0PIII 667mhz\u00a0Software;\u00a0cubase 5.1 + vst(i)\u00a0Bram Bos Hammerhead &amp; tuareq\u00a0Propellorhead rebirth\u00a0Hardware;\u00a0behringer mixer\u00a0Virtualizer (x2)\u00a0Modulalizer\u00a0Roland Alpha Juno II\u00a0Tracks recorded straight to a Philips cdr 930 mini audio cd recorder.\ncredits\nreleased 31 December 2000\u00a0","album_date_released":"12\/31\/2000","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"36","album_listens":"2557","album_date_created":"1\/02\/2015 08:36:57 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Richard_Jonas_-_2000_Selection_-_20150102203657333.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"28851","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"17410","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Richard_Jonas_-_2000_Selection_-_20150102203657333.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 2000 Selection.","image_caption":"2000 Selection.","image_copyright":"richard jonas","image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":["glitchhop","electronica","instrumentals","breakbeat","drum and bass","jungle","hiphop","hiphop instrumentals","glitch experimental electronic"]},{"album_id":"13966","album_title":"2001 Selection.","album_handle":"2001_Selection","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/jonas_the_plugexpert\/2001_Selection\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"jonas the plugexpert","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/jonas_the_plugexpert\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>To celebrate 10 years of my bad pun artist name and many failed attempts at syncopation, I've made a selection of tracks that I've created in 2001. There must be something in it that is still likable to someone, somewhere, somehow ;-) . 2001 was the year where I acquired my own pc with cutting edge cd burner and had to switch to Cubase 5.1 + vst's as my beloved fasttracker didn't work in the than new Windows 98. At first the changed set-up meant much mouse clicking frustration in the (beat) programming department, often resulting in sparse and minimal segmented tunes as I couldn't be bothered spending more time on melody or progression, words that didn't\/don't mean much to me anyway. Any hint of melody in most of these, is thin, the notes are rigidly quantized, even lacking variation in dynamics. Tonal elements repeat in short patterns at fixed intervals, like short station calls implying structure, but probably not resulting in an emotional impact and thus tracks can come across cold and absent of any intention or goal. I can't remember having any other aim at the time than having fun creating 'fat' beats, as is still often the motive. Nevertheless, said excuses and resulting impersonal music does have its charm and moments... lol.<\/p>","album_date_released":"12\/31\/2001","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"60","album_listens":"2602","album_date_created":"4\/05\/2013 08:32:04 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/jonas_the_plugexpert_-_2001_Selection_-_20130405220139345.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"30114","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Lately_Kind_of_Yeah_-_20150426224247794.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":["beats","drums","syncopation","netherlands","breakcore","c64","holland","drillnbass","amiga 500","bass","breakbeat","tracker music","renoise","chiptune","glitch","braindance","electronica","idm"]},{"album_id":"18362","album_title":"2002","album_handle":"2002","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Rgis_Victor\/2002\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"R\u00c9GIS VICTOR","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Rgis_Victor\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"24","album_listens":"48922","album_date_created":"5\/29\/2015 05:25:46 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/RGIS_VICTOR_-_2002_-_2015052952143907.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"30437","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"18362","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/RGIS_VICTOR_-_2002_-_2015052952143907.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"13965","album_title":"2002 Selection.","album_handle":"2002_Selection","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/jonas_the_plugexpert\/2002_Selection\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"jonas the plugexpert","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/jonas_the_plugexpert\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"This compilation of tracks, all made in 2002 represent my early attempts at IDM, going for that glitchy beat sound with the obligatory detuned pad and melancholic harmonies on top ;-) ...\n<p>Album cover photo by Jeroen ( <a href=\"mailto:info@thefriendlystranger.nl\">info@thefriendlystranger.nl<\/a> ) taken in Bea 5, the analogue studio of the Royal Conservatory in the Hague. <\/p>\n See more work of Jeroen here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thefriendlystranger.nl\">www.thefriendlystranger.nl<\/a>","album_date_released":"12\/31\/2002","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"12","album_listens":"3148","album_date_created":"4\/05\/2013 07:45:45 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/jonas_the_plugexpert_-_2002_Selection_-_20130405201056858.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"23056","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"13965","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/jonas_the_plugexpert_-_2002_Selection_-_20130405201056858.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 2002 Selection.","image_caption":"Jonas The Plugexpert 2002 Selection.","image_copyright":"Jeroen ( info@thefriendlystranger.nl )","image_source":"http:\/\/f0.bcbits.com\/z\/15\/93\/1593639997-1.jpg","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"9877","album_title":"2003 summer mixtape","album_handle":"2003_summer_mixtape","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Fat_Worm_of_Error\/2003_summer_mixtape\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Fat Worm of Error","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Fat_Worm_of_Error\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><\/p><p>originally released on Cassette by Yeay!

I consider this an \"ambient protest\" album (and there aren't too many of those around) - the perfect background listening for tax filing.<br \/><br \/> To learn more about Scott and his projects, visit his blog or listen to his ambient show on stillstream. <br \/><br \/> From Scott: <br \/><br \/> \"The title of this work reflects a faceless presence, a universality that is being implemented in the future of healthcare which the concept is a rejection of by the very dark nature of the music and it's mood. <br \/><br \/> The fact that we are becoming nothing more than statistical data and account numbers... Our individuality growing more obsolete with each passing year is presented as a fundamental change to the human condition in some cases where we are simply nothing more than numerical constructs to the government and major corporations who are taking over our lives more and more each day. <br \/><br \/> Though the concept in this recording is just demonstrated in one area, it is still a universal outcry of the people of a nation whose government is doing more than simply overseeing the individuals they are supposed to represent. <br \/><br \/> The ever-growing body of officials are not satisfied with merely leading, they want to control every aspect of every individual life and create a \"we\" and do away with the \"I\". <br \/><br \/> This then, is my personal protest against the radical elimination of personal freedom and dignity for each individual and it is my hope, that after hearing this music, you, the listener, if you've felt a sense of your personal freedom lost in whatever aspect of your life is important, that you will be able to take small steps, which can lead to giant leaps to regain that which has been eroded over the years by governing bodies who believe that we are not individuals, but simply parts of a giant collective. <br \/><br \/> My most heartfelt thanks goes out to my good friend Shannah Kueffler who was of invaluable assistance in answering all my medical questions as well as making sure that all effects were as true to nature as they could be for the project.

Smith<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This album has been made entirely from samples taken from the Midnight Crossroads Tape Recorder Blues album, which I made with Ralf Wehowsky for A Bruit Secret. Like that album it is a tribute to the spirit of the blues, viewed through a prism of 21st century cultural criticism. It evokes an earlier era when the relationship between a performer and a song arose out of a community, not a property relation. In appropriating my own material I have short-circuited the prevailing ethos of piracy and bricolage, and returned in a sense, to my self.  Despite being made in New Zealand, and using some recordings from the Rhineland, the two places that are really central to this album are the Mississippi Delta and the island of Jamaica.<\/p>\n<p>-Bruce Russell<\/p>","album_date_released":"11\/01\/2006","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"13","album_listens":"5423","album_date_created":"6\/23\/2009 12:36:51 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Bruce_Russell_-_21st_Century_Field_Hollers_and_Prison_Songs_-_2009113012040537.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"3250","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"3548","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Bruce_Russell_-_21st_Century_Field_Hollers_and_Prison_Songs_-_2009113012040537.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 21st Century Field Hollers and Prison Songs","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":"cc-by","image_source":"http:\/\/www.mattin.org\/recordings.html","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"21187","album_title":"23-12-2015-Registro en vivo en la salvajeria","album_handle":"23-12-2015-Registro_en_vivo_en_la_salvajeria","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Ensamble_isamitt\/23-12-2015-Registro_en_vivo_en_la_salvajeria\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Ensamble Isamitt","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Ensamble_isamitt\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;

At its heart, a spire, so tall, so baroque, so architecturally unsound yet defiantly standing. As if it had once exploded into being, it shoots myriad walkways from itself that curl up into what resembles a high concept wireframe of an actually inhabitable cityscape-to-be.<\/p>\n<p>I grab your hand and we go down one of the walkways. It\u2019s as if entering a spiderweb that hasn\u2019t even the decency to snare you. It just taunts and warns of a spider somewhere. Everything is both an underpass and an overpass. We\u2019ll never know how we stand.<\/p>\n<p>Everything is cold to the touch, everything is cold to the EAR. Ringing pipes, clamoring catwalks, bellowing surfaces. We walk not though a city, but through a leviathan of metal alloys, who\u2019s stomach growls as a banshee haunts, for we are the indigestion. \u00a0If not for petrol and diseases, we\u2019d be the sole organic matter, you and I. And with the sky red and the clouds black, the winds gone and the rain sulphuric, I\u2019m not even sure how we manage to stay that way.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we march on. There are no clocks here. The stars we cannot see. The city is eternal, static, desolate, unchanging. And with day and night no longer distinct and a destination meaningless, time becomes but a device of self-cohesion. If not for the succession of thoughts, I fear we would dissipate into forever.<\/p>\n<p>But lo, we\u2019ve come upon an opening. As if cut into the fabric of our sight itself, the cave mouth smiles at us. An impossibly smooth detonation carved this into being\u2026 loose pipes and sparking circuitboards line the sides. We fearlessly enter, the strangeness showing promise in this land of despoilment. At the end of the snaking passage\u2026 a room.<\/p>\n<p>In a world where everything is either hub or cockpit\u2026. A simple room. A living room, in fact. We greet long-lost brothers: wood, dust, mold! Cobwebs! We walk along the creaking wooden floor, every creak an otherworldly delight, to a sheet-covered apparition, and pull the sheet away to reveal\u2026 the most missed of all brothers\u2026 furniture! Ottomans, divans, fainting couches, coffee tables, armoires, sofas, armchairs, a darling china cabinet. All antique, all gorgeous, all functional only in the amount one is willing to invest in them. Form over function. What a relief. All awaited here, covered in sheets, as if surrendered to their ghostly fate.

This image nearly became a reality until the change. The  biological reclaimed the technological. Earth was renamed \u2018The Garden\u2019.

There are still distinct groups of \u2018humans\u2019 that live  separately from one another. Some choose to let their biological side  define them; some choose to employ more of technological side. Some  intentionally meddle with their own DNA and turn themselves into things  which are indescribable. There is one other group that no one is quite  sure whether or not they still exist. They are the remnants of the time  just after the change and live in shadow. Nothing more than stories  about them surface from time to time.

The same  lazers we use to defend ourselves against the squids has also been  altered for our creative purposes. I am a lazer furniture designer \u2013 the  last of the true artisans.<\/p>\n<p>Sometime in the 2700s humans began to perceive eachother as pure  energy and art was no longer necessary, everything one ever could or  needed to express was already visible to our naked eyes. We the  furniture designers have developed an advanced system of lucid dreaming  which takes us into the dark infinite regions of inner space. The images  we bring back from these strange places are carved with lazer and sat  upon, or have coffee rested upon. Some of us never come back.\"<\/p>\n<p>From: <a title=\"http:\/\/kingdeluxe.ca\/lazer-furniture-designer\/\" href=\"http:\/\/kingdeluxe.ca\/lazer-furniture-designer\/\" target=\"_self\">http:\/\/kingdeluxe.ca\/lazer-furniture-designer\/<\/a> where you can download the full hi-res image from <a title=\"http:\/\/chriswrightshandcandy.blogspot.com\/\" href=\"http:\/\/chriswrightshandcandy.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_self\">Christopher Wright<\/a><\/p>","album_date_released":"12\/10\/2010","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"3813","album_date_created":"7\/27\/2011 03:56:33 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Duran_Duran_Duran_-_2999_Lazer_Furniture_Designer_-_20110727155916833.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"15002","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"9720","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Duran_Duran_Duran_-_2999_Lazer_Furniture_Designer_-_20110727155916833.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 2999: Lazer Furniture Designer","image_caption":"Art by Christopher Wright","image_copyright":"Christopher Wright","image_source":"http:\/\/kingdeluxe.ca\/lazer-furniture-designer\/","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"8086","album_title":"2999: Out Of The Unknown","album_handle":"2999_Out_Of_The_Unknown","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/El_Hajin\/2999_Out_Of_The_Unknown\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"El Hajin","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/El_Hajin\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>For more than 300 years, humans explored space outside of the solar \nsystem. Planets have been colonized, science has reached a status where \nnearly everything is explainable.<\/p>\n<p>This was the truth until 2999, when a new region in space was \ndiscovered. Lacking the presence of stars or material, this anomaly was \nsimply called \"the gap\". It was surrounded by a thick nebular, which \nwouldn't allow any ship to scan it. Every ship or probe which engaged \nthis area would never return.<\/p>\n<p>Humans decided to build a permanent outpost at a respectful distance \nfrom the gap. In April 2999, the crew of the outpost sent a message \nwhich said, some strange vessel, which no one of the crew had ever seen,\n was heading straight towards the station. This was the last \ntransmission from this outpost. The Vessel came out of \"the gap\".

In that, I suppose, the majority of\nrecorded eai discs are essentially live performances and generally of a\nsubtle nature, this problem can be especially thorny. So it was a nice\nhappenstance that I received this set the other day which contains\nthree recordings from different vantage points within the concert\nspace, using different equipment, of an event created by Rowe and\nWright in Derby, 2002.<br \/><br \/>\nThe music itself is pretty fine, Rowe in\nkind of post-Weather Sky mode. I'm much less familiar with Wright's\nhistory but here, he seems to travel between blown and\npercussive\/rubbed sounds on his alto. It would take many more\ncomparative listens to determine what's missing in one version, what's\nheard in another and, in all honesty, I doubt I'll get to that level of\ninterrogation. There are salient \"events\" easily picked out of the sea\nof abstraction and I guess one could isolate them, play them back to\nback, note the variations, but someone else, not me. <br \/><br \/>\nWhat I\ncan do, however, and am indeed doing as I type this, is play all three\nsimultaneously. It so happens I have three CD-playing devices in my\nroom: the stereo, the PC and the XBox and while the latter two aren't\nby any means ideal, it's worth a go. I noticed the total time varied\nsomewhat so precise syncing seemed a fool's errand and, besides, I'm\nnot so much interested in that as in constructing a \"blurred\"\nperformance, so I just began them within 15 or so seconds of each other\nand am sitting back and enjoying the result. Since my stereo speakers\nare to the rear and the other two in front of me, I automatically get a\nspatial effect I don't in routine listening. Plus, it seems the events\nof the concert are enough out of sync that there's no real echo effect,\nrather gaps of 30-40 seconds between recognizable episodes. Sounds\ngreat, actually! Hard to imagine, now, listening to it otherwise.\n(Coincidentally, I played Terry Riley's \"You're No Good\" at Record Club\nthis past week, so I have that quasi-similar experiment kicking around\nin the noodle as well. I was also reminded of the set Mattin did with\nMalfatti at Tonic a couple years back where he recorded audience sound,\nplaying it back some minutes later, enough time having elapsed that\none's recollection of a given cough or chair squeak was slightly\nuncertain). Just now, some 23 minutes in, Wright lets loose with four\nrelatively clear honks; they made it from XBox to PC to stereo in about\na minute, the way the discs are staggered and did, in fact, sound\nremarkably different in tone, richness, etc. (allowing, to be sure, for\nthe relative deficiencies of my own playback equipment) When Wright\nbegins (I'm assuming) jangling metal objects against his horn or within\nits bell, the immersive, shimmering effect is quite ticklish! <br \/><br \/>\nIn that it's on w.m.o\/r, you can readily try this yourself (or not),\nvia free download <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mattin.org\/recordings\/3D.html\">here<\/a>.\nI highly recommend doing so and, if you have the means, experiencing\nthe three discs more or less at once.

style=\"color: #666666; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;\">The band was originally formed in 1994, out of boredom, in Laval, a suburb of Montreal. At the beginning, the \"aim\" of the group was to improvise lyrics and melodies on karaoke music. But, in 2003, the now enlarged group decided to take a more straightforward approach by abandoning the karaoke music and by creating their own sounding. First, the songs are imagined, written and composed by Joel Chevalier and then vocalized by Caroline Fournier, Jacynthe Fradette, Solange Lavergne and Evelyne Mireault. Sometimes, there are special guests like Marc-Andr\u00e9 Lemaire- Perreault and Simon Garcia. \"Now, the main objective of our work is to make people believe in 'indirect humor'. But, of course, to appreciate our songs, one must have an above normal artistic sense and highly developed sensitivity. We use absurdity to express simple elements or events of everyday life\" composer Chevalier says.<\/span><\/p>","album_date_released":"8\/17\/2004","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"17","album_listens":"1499","album_date_created":"5\/12\/2015 11:34:04 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Joel_Knight_Chevalier_And_Unexpected_Social_Images_-_450_-_20150512112934547.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"30295","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"18250","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Joel_Knight_Chevalier_And_Unexpected_Social_Images_-_450_-_20150512112934547.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 450","image_caption":"Joel Knight Chevalier and Unexpected Social Images","image_copyright":"Joel Knight Chevalier and Unexpected Social Images","image_source":"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/csr043","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"7432","album_title":"48 Hour EP Vol. 1","album_handle":"48_Hour_EP_Vol_1","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/The_J_Arthur_Keenes_Band\/48_Hour_EP_Vol_1\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"The J.

think 48v is much of anything really. it's a  simple piece with a very functional use for me. early this summer, i  couldn't sleep due to the lawnmowers, street paving, highways, planes,  and air conditioners which kept me rustling in my bed. rather than try  to ignore these sounds, i decided to make something that would  neutralize them; something that did not to drown out the sounds through  volume or negate them. the goal was to make something that would work to  congeal with the disruptive sounds and create a pleasing whole.<\/p>\n<p class=\"style1\">i felt i needed to use these particular sounds and my  particular organization of them to work in my environment. i can only  hope that it is useful in different locations and for different  purposes.<\/p>\n<p

Herod","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Elvis_Herod\/","album_producer":"Elvis Herod","album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Elvis Herod \/ 8-Bit Night Shift<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When Elvis Herod isn't making music and drinking to excess, he sometimes does proper jobs. From April (18th) until May (14th), he worked night shifts at a power station in Scotland, as part of a rope rescue team (that's when you rescue rope, of course).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Mr Herod offers you over an hour and a half of electronic computer pop music that he put together during his stay at Mouswald caravan park. Stitched lovingly together with the sewing needles of passion, throughout a stint of stone cold sobriety.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The track titles of this retro-spacktive opus mainly consist of events, characters, places, ideas and objects encountered during Herod's time in Lockerbie, Mouswald, Lochmaben and Dumfries. Herod's musical production activity during this time, has been running parallel with a wretched head cold and some incredibly painful toothache (the latter, worriedly inspiring the title to track 16). This pain, however, has been successfully suppressed by the positive morale of the eight-man (or 8-bit) workforce, who have, due to shifting sleeping patterns and moments of unbalanced mentality, helped Herod enjoy his time in Sconny Botland!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Throughout his stay in \u00a0Mouswald, Herod has trolled through his own archive of sound recordings, predominately consisting of himself and some of his ludicrous cronies in inebriated states, at parties and gatherings (and such). These chopped up recordings have been boiled gently into some parts of the fabric of this epic creation, as a contradictory melting pot of both, teetotal composition and bibulous sound-bites -arranged within, as a sort of boozy-glue.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Seeing as Herod has swapped the drink for creating music (in the guise of an owl in a high-visibility vest), the hypothetical 'liver of his mind' has been intoxicated with other substances. Instead, he has been imbibing Scotland. The people and places, seen and visited have served as Herod's temporary brain-beverage. There have been many manic periods of bovine abstraction and arduous conversations with an army of drunken Czechoslovakian welders. Moments of impalpable, conceptualized pheasant lifestyle imaginings and the unfortunate death of a bunny rabbit (which Herod was not at all responsible for).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Of course, when anyone is \u00a0living in close proximity to Herod, there will always be complaints of his monstrous snoring (subsequently assigning track 18's title, as well as inspiring track 6), which was aptly described by one of his colleagues as \u201cSnoring that you feel, rather than hear...\u201d. The aforementioned individual fleetingly returned home before the end of the job, which Herod still claims to be, not entirely responsible for.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As well as all of that, there are re-workings of two previous Herod tracks, a song about a supermarket bag, tunes about about both gas and poo, one about sugar consumption, and one about the end of a friendship due to three times the penetrative sex organ during intercourse. There are tracks channelling Herod's hatred for celebrity fashion and mobile phones, and a song about his love for the night sky. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There's also a song called Danny Glover, so that's nice isn't it?<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>WARNING: There are some very naughty words featured on this album, so try not to listen to it if you're not into that sort of thing.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Front Cover Artwork by Douglas Pledger.<\/p>\n<p>You can check out more of his amazing work at:<\/p>\n<p>douggy.com<\/p>\n<p>utterphilth.com<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Elvis Herod hopes that you enjoy this album and would like to especially thank:<\/p>\n<p>Ben, Fisher, other Ben, Bob, Jordan, Waz and Lee.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to the drunken people who have unknowingly contributed to this album:<\/p>\n<p>Barrold, Oblivian, Marie, Rob, Ptom, \u00a0Matt, Chris, Moon and Danny.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thanks also, to family, friends and acquaintances:<\/p>\n<p>Carrie, Chris, Patrick, Mick, John, Sarah, Dave, Kate, Ric, Lynsey, Matty, \u00a0Nicky, Vicky, Che, Sean, Em, Shelley, Clare, Nico, Beef, The Artist Formally Known as E.

Relying heavily on sampling, the EP succeeds in being a very personal (and thus, original) piece of work that attempts to capture what makes each of us unique, things like personal memories and the places we have grown in. Its sound circles basically 2 cities, Constanta, major Romanian town by the sea side, and Bucharest, our beloved capital city. More than a geographical location, Minus' release also focuses on a specific time frame, the years between 1990 and 2010.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:11px;\">\"95\" has the sheer energy of a 1990 Romanian disco club revisited with a 2010 post-rave attitude. It's like reading The Three Musketeers after spending the weekend dancing in Berlin. Its about reading your past and individuality with today's eyes. The EP delivers a personal story that somehow gets us involved in it. We get to think what makes us who we are. We get to trip through our own history. Minus mixes quite a range of complex elements in a seductive and balanced music package that even if suits perfectly the joie de vivre of the summer, it could easily warm the coldest of the winters.<\/p>\n","album_date_released":"7\/15\/2010","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"2","album_tracks":"7","album_listens":"32762","album_date_created":"7\/27\/2010 05:38:00 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Minus_-_95_-_2010072754014126.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"9216","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"6903","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Minus_-_95_-_2010072754014126.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 95","image_caption":"Minus - 95","image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":["minus","bucharest","skweee","romania","hip hop","local records","wonky"]},{"album_id":"5702","album_title":"96","album_handle":"96","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Karl_Blau\/96\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Karl Blau","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Karl_Blau\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theconnextion.com\/karlblau\/index.cfm?AC=0\">(Karl Blau)<\/a><\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"3","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"998","album_date_created":"2\/25\/2010 04:21:31 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Karl_Blau_-_96_-_20100225151658866.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"6789","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"5702","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Karl_Blau_-_96_-_20100225151658866.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: 96","image_caption":"96","image_copyright":"Karl Blau","image_source":"http:\/\/www.theconnextion.com\/karlblau\/index.cfm?AC=0","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"15881","album_title":"99 Problems\/Luftballons","album_handle":"99_ProblemsLuftballons","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/mangulicaFM\/99_ProblemsLuftballons\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"mangulicaFM","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/mangulicaFM\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><a>Somewhere between 99 problems - illuminati perfected product of Jay-Z and Rick Rubin in 2000s and 99 luftballons by romantic Germany's contestant on Eurovision in the early 80s stands a slash symbol.

Hybrid\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This is a shared-sample project. Create a single new piece of music by employing the selected material of each the following three tracks. See below.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>All three of these tracks were initially posted to the Internet with a Creative Commons license encouraging derivative reworking. This project \u2014 one in an ongoing series of netlabel remixes undertaken by the Disquiet Junto \u2014 is intended to address the unfortunate popularity of \u201cND\u201d (i.e., \u201cno derivatives\u201d) licenses among netlabels.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Please only use the following material in your piece; you can transform in any way you choose, but do not introduce any new source material. The music originated on these three netlabels: Birdsong, Inoquo, and Qunabu.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>1: Use the first 10 seconds of \u201cDark City\u201d by Marc Pastco off the 12AX7 album, released by inoquo.com, based in Barcelona, Spain. MP3: <a title=\"goo.gl\/MXDTJv\" href=\"\/manage\/albums\/edit\/goo.gl\/MXDTJv\" target=\"_blank\">goo.gl\/MXDTJv<\/a><\/p>\n<p>2: Use the second 10 seconds (i.e., from :11 to :20) of \u201cZamenhof Blues\u201d by Digital_Me (Shay Librowski) off the The Accordion E.P., released by birdsong.co.il, based in Israel. MP3: <a title=\"goo.gl\/ysydcH\" href=\"\/manage\/albums\/edit\/goo.gl\/ysydcH%20\" target=\"_blank\">goo.gl\/ysydcH\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>3: Use the third 10 seconds (i.e., from :21 to :30) of \u201cArchean\u201d by PlotKA off the Circulation of Deposits EP, released by netlabel.qunabu.com, based in Gda\u0144sk, Poland. MP3: <a title=\"goo.gl\/pM9AqI\" href=\"\/manage\/albums\/edit\/goo.gl\/pM9AqI\" target=\"_blank\">goo.gl\/pM9AqI<\/a><\/p>\n<p>My Approach: For this one I just started snipping pieces that I thought sounded interesting, my early results had what I would consider a dub sound but I kept snipping the samples down further and further until I ended up with some kind of \"glitch dub\". So here it is, whatever it is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Track 3:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This track was made for Disquiet Junto project 0097-page99remix\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Disquiet Junto Project 0097: Ford Madox Ford Page 99 Remix\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This week's project takes as its source a comment attributed to the author Ford Madox Ford: \"Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you.\" We will convert text from page 99 of various books into music.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: Pick up the book you are currently reading, or otherwise the first book you see nearby.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: Turn to page 99. Confirm that the page has enough consecutive text in it to add up to 80 characters.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 2a: If the page is blank or otherwise has no text, turn to page 98. Continue this process of moving backward through the book until your find an appropriate page.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 2b: If you are reading an ebook that lacks page numbers, or a book that happens to lack page numbers, then use the first page of the main body of the book (i.e., not the Library of Congress information or the table of contents) or flip to a random spot\/page in the book.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: When you have located 80 consecutive characters, type them into a document on your computer or write the down on a piece of paper.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: You will turn these characters into music by following the following rules:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 4a: The letters A through L will correspond with the notes along the chromatic scale from A to G#. To convert a letter higher than L, simply cycle through the scale again (i.e., L = G#, M = A, etc.). Capital letters should be played slightly louder than lowercase letters.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 4b: Any spaces and any dashes\/hyphens will be treated as blank, as a silent moment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 4c: A comma or semicolon will signify a note one step below the preceding note.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 4d: A period, question mark, or exclamation point will signify a note one step above the preceding note.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 4e: All other punctuation (colon, ampersand, etc.) will be heard as a percussive beat.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: Record the piece of music using a digital or analog instrument.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 6: Set the pace for the recording to between 160 and 80 beats per minute (BPM). In other words, the track should be between 30 and 60 seconds in length.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Step 7: Add any desired underlying music or sound bed, and any additional instrumentation, but the melody resulting from Step 6 should be the most prominent sound.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>My Source: Microsound by Curtis Roads\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Page 99: \"When the delay interval between the grains is irregular, perfect grain syn-chr\"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Track 5:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Disquiet Junto Project 0083: R#d#ct#d\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This week\u2019s project is an open-ended exploration of surveillance and graphic notation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The page at the following URL is the score that you will perform:\u00a0<a title=\"goo.gl\/eYX80X\" href=\"\/manage\/albums\/edit\/goo.gl\/eYX80X%20\" target=\"_blank\">goo.gl\/eYX80X\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can use any instrumentation you choose, just no source audio for which you cannot yourself claim ownership or fair use.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Background: The image is page 8 of recently declassified documents related to NSA collection of telephone metadata records.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>My Comments: In keeping in the theme of this project I wanted to deal with the concept of words that are fully present but obscured. I used a segment of the Sunday, May 26, 2013 episode of the Music Manumit Podcast interviewing C. Reider for my voices ( <a title=\"www.musicmanumit.com\/2013\/05\/c-reid\u2026t-podcast.html\" href=\"http:\/\/www.musicmanumit.com\/2013\/05\/c-reid%E2%80%A6t-podcast.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.musicmanumit.com\/2013\/05\/c-reid\u2026t-podcast.html<\/a> ). The podcast audio is used under a CC-BY-SA license and contains the voices of Tom Ray, Doug Whitfield and C. Reider. I used Supercollider to granulate and mutate the voices until they were indecipherable and added some other sounds to build a framework for the voices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Track 6:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Created with Supercollider.

The result is nothing but a sensitive and serious record that will keep you from moving away from your music player. In \"A Derrota da Engrenagem\", the songs presented by Lu\u00eds Fernandes seem to be somewhere between post-rock, (occasionally) experimental, and some sort of atmospheric cruise. You'll picture one of his captain's logs, a report that will not appear abruptly, that will not produce harsh sounds for distracted listeners. It might be a little hard though for those with spiritual breathing difficulties to survive this cruise, but if you choose to go on a trip with the astroboy you will be able to gaze at the stars through the amazing glass of his spaceship...\u00bb <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Release notes by <strong>Filipe Miranda <\/strong>in <a href=\"http:\/\/testtube.monocromatica.com\/releases\/tube067.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Test Tube website<\/a>.<\/p>","album_date_released":"2\/28\/2007","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"6","album_listens":"6621","album_date_created":"10\/20\/2012 10:35:01 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/The_Astroboy_-_A_Derrota_da_Engrenagem_-_20121020103546080.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"20850","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"12674","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/The_Astroboy_-_A_Derrota_da_Engrenagem_-_20121020103546080.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A Derrota da Engrenagem","image_caption":"Cover by aeriola::behaviour","image_copyright":"CC BY-NC-ND","image_source":"http:\/\/testtube.monocromatica.com\/releases\/tube067.htm","image_order":"1"},{"image_id":"20851","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"12674","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/The_Astroboy_-_A_Derrota_da_Engrenagem_-_20121020103620410.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A Derrota da Engrenagem","image_caption":"Back by aeriola::behaviour","image_copyright":"CC BY-NC-ND","image_source":"http:\/\/testtube.monocromatica.com\/releases\/tube067.htm","image_order":"2"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"10553","album_title":"A devasted place where we can dance","album_handle":"A_devasted_place_where_we_can_dance","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/endingsatellites\/A_devasted_place_where_we_can_dance\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Ending Satellites","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/endingsatellites\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>EP#2 from Ending Satellites.<\/p>","album_date_released":"3\/15\/2011","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"2","album_listens":"2280","album_date_created":"12\/08\/2011 02:31:31 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ending_Satellites_-_A_devasted_place_where_we_can_dance_-_2011120813859109.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"16715","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"10553","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ending_Satellites_-_A_devasted_place_where_we_can_dance_-_2011120813859109.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"18478","album_title":"A Dudva Visszate\u0301r II","album_handle":"A_Dudva_Visszater_II","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gazprom\/A_Dudva_Visszater_II\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Gazprom","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gazprom\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"5647","album_date_created":"6\/24\/2015 04:16:48 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Gazprom_-_A_Dudva_Visszater_II_-_20150624161026589.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"30646","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"18478","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Gazprom_-_A_Dudva_Visszater_II_-_20150624161026589.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A Dudva Visszate\u0301r II","image_caption":"Gazprom","image_copyright":"Gazprom","image_source":"https:\/\/gazprom.bandcamp.com\/releases","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"20177","album_title":"A Dying Paradise","album_handle":"A_Dying_Paradise_1250","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gumbel\/A_Dying_Paradise_1250\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Gumbel","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gumbel\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>--- The 14 tracks of this longplayer are marked as IDM and that's quite the truth: A large variety of sounds and ideas including all sections of modern electronica, from classical loops to thrilling breakbeats.

I'm Wrangler Wolf, here to tell ya about the latest and greatest album by People Like Us, entitled \"A Fistful of Knuckles\". You all prob'ly recognize the name People Like Us (or as some folks out my way say, \"People Like Cuss\"!) as being that of one of the finest darn \"plunderphonic\" performing and recording artists of the modern age. It's the work of one young lass, by the name of Vicki Bennett, who slices and dices so much darn sound all at once, which she's grabbed from who-knows-whut and who-knows-where, that you might think you're listening to a tornado of sound whippin' up the prairie. After listening to a decade of CD and LP releases from People Like Us, I figured I'd heard it all... not so! For when I threw on this here \"A Fistful of Knuckles\" I knew I was in hog heaven and for whole new reasons. You see, she's decided to stick to one single theme this time out: camp... as in \"camp-fire\". That's right, she's chucked a whole load of sing-a-long tunes and trail ridin' classics right in a big ol' heap on the flames and watched 'em sizzle. She done listened to so much cowboy music and watched so many Western movies that she had no choicebut to throw in all in her little blender and create this crazy monster of deconstruc.. decon... deconstuck... aw, hell, I can't pronounce the darn word, but I'm sure you know what I'm talkin' about. And she enlisted a bit of help from her friends on this one, like fellow sound-mining buddies Wobbly and The Jet Black Hair People, Mr. Rotorvator, MC Schmertz, Ricky Dagner and other young folks, too. Hell, I wish she'd of asked me to play my harmonica on it... but I guess she had too darn much to wrestle with already.\"...A Fistful of Knuckles, the latest album by Vicki Bennett's wry sound-collage project, People Like Us (Caciocavallo). Constructed entirely of samples from Westerns and rousing campfire singalongs, Bennett skillfully twists wholesome hoe-downs into thinly veiled innuendoes, smearing the record with a latent sexual deviance. A sly and enjoyable corruption of the macho cowboy stereotype - all whips, spurs and leather chaps - giving new meaning to the phrase 'saddle 'em up and ride, boys' [7]\"-- Piers Martin in the NME : February 2001\"People Like Us is simply too good. Why it presents us again and again CD, like a circus. One must win something distance from this music, thus her one not flatly with the endless heavily meaning basic sounds and memories. Here to the world between American white diapers, Pferdchen those the world mean, Kleinkinderklukluxklansofties and other one like Country, donkeys, sakeless Schubidus and cold kriegern in a leckeren soup. People Like US is like cinema, like which old humans at MTV finds so exciting always, these many cuts, only the cuts are not cuts, but, deeply inside into this world from sound the world of the television offers precise interventions to surgical quality, without it would refer to expressly drauf that that really like that it is but supplies actually only for People Like US material, which so unconsciously passed through quasi by us that one can cannibalize it ever further and further. Carefully naturally and with a Manie CUT copy paste of the Artworkings, which one, once belonged never again loose will. \" A Fistful OF Knuckles \" is the terminator point of a long long search to the praised country, which ran from the east coast in long Trecks to the west coast, made a stopover with John Wayne over in People Like US to end.\" - translation from de-bug magazineA Fistful of Knuckles, the latest album by Vicki Bennett's wry sound-collage project, People Like Us (Caciocavallo).

This makes A Magical Approach    - a new release of Jerome Cooper's multi-dimensional drumming, a very special    event. The music on this CD is drawn from two live performances, recorded almost    30 years apart. Root Assumptions was recorded in 1978 while the other five tracks    are from Cooper's 2007 performance at an A.A.C.M. concert. Cooper's remarkable    agility and captivating musical spirit is enacted throughout these endearing    works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:x-small;\"> What is multi-dimensional    drumming? Imagine a drummer who plays this flute with one hand, bass drum and    high-hat with his feet, and triggers drum loops, chord sequences and bass patterns    with his other hand. Whether it is written or improvised, the resulting music    is closer to world-funk than avant-garde jazz. Divided into many parts and facets,    the drum set and secondary instruments Cooper uses and play are all aspects    of the drums. In the future, there will be many changes and developments in    the area of the mind, so what we (humankind) think and hear, is what we shall    see and hear. In order to play the drum set you must be able to manipulate four    or five things at one time (i.e. bass drum, snare drum, high-hat, ride cymbals    and maybe voice). So an instruments name and structure doesn't stop him from    playing them like a drum. You have instruments that are structurally different    from the drum, but they have the same characteristic in the approach to the    drum (i.e. piano, balaphone and shoes with taps). In order to find the music    of the drums, Cooper had to change my assumptions and beliefs about music in    relation to the drums, which is sound in the creation of multi-rhythms.<\/span><\/p>","album_date_released":"7\/15\/2010","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"2097","album_date_created":"8\/03\/2010 04:08:34 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Jerome_Cooper_-_A_Magical_approach_-_20100803160153846.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"7313","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/colab_-_20100401164625454.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":"Colab","image_copyright":"Colab","image_source":"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/colabtoronto"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"13199","album_title":"A Magnifique Bande dos Homes sen Medo","album_handle":"A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo\/A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"A Magnifique Bande dos Homes sen Medo","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":"11\/05\/2012","album_comments":"6","album_favorites":"2","album_tracks":"5","album_listens":"11442","album_date_created":"1\/03\/2013 06:09:46 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo_-_A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo_-_2013010361506947.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"21774","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"13199","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo_-_A_Magnifique_Bande_dos_Homes_sen_Medo_-_2013010361506947.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A Magnifique Bande dos Homes sen Medo","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":["new orleans"]},{"album_id":"15857","album_title":"A Man Disappeared Once","album_handle":"A_Man_Disappeared_Once","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Kirk_Pearson\/A_Man_Disappeared_Once\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Kirk Pearson","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Kirk_Pearson\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Louis Le Prince was a French inventor who, in 1888, recorded the first ever continuous motion picture. The film wasn't much, a few seconds of footage filmed in the town square of Leeds, but gifted Le Prince the title of \"the mechanical king\" back home. On the evening of September 16, 1890, Le Prince boarded the express train to Paris in route to patent his invention. As the train stopped the following morning, both the man and his luggage had vanished from his sealed compartment. As far as the legal records go, Le Prince was never seen again. Some insist he was murdered by an ex-lover. An even more persistent theory is that Thomas Edison orchestrated his kidnapping, so he could take credit for the motion picture (which he did). His son insisted that Le Prince, a bit of a recluse, had spoken of a \u201cperfect suicide,\u201d where an individual could dematerialize and become public mystery. As society forgot his name, Le Prince would live on and keep slowly gifting his inventions to the public. This was, of course, far before the advent of the World Wide Web; an invention beyond the wildest dreams of even Louis Le Prince. In the early 2000s, as private collectors started uploading vast photo archives, a few history fanatics started noticing strange appearances of an all-too familiar face. He not only appears in a police photo of a drowned man, but as a spectator of a lecture delivered by Albert Einstein, as a man performing microbial tests in a New York laboratory and as a traveling salesman in southeast India. The photos were not only taken after his death, but up to seventy years following. If one believes the man in question is indeed Le Prince, history would suggest he lived at least two hundred years; perhaps even longer. I don\u2019t intend to prompt further conspiracy about the story, but rather used the urban legend as a backdrop for a larger narrative. Le Prince, the \u201cmechanical king,\u201d is a case study for what happens when people go missing. We may not have his personal belongings, but we still have his films, his invention and his image. Le Prince created a virtual system of immortality. This theme of disappearance is nothing new to the musical medium. This is an EP about lost places, people and time: a narrative story of the place that lost things go. Each piece in this album tells a fragment of an larger narrative-- puzzle pieces of an incomplete story, if you will. Thus, the tracks may be listened to in any order you desire. We sincerely hope you have as much fun listening to this music as we had making it.<\/p>","album_date_released":"1\/03\/2014","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"6","album_listens":"16130","album_date_created":"1\/19\/2014 12:28:51 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kirk_Pearson_and_Julian_Korzeniowsky_-_A_Man_Disappeared_Once_-_20140118232511517.png","album_images":[{"image_id":"22882","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Soni_Ventorum_-_20130327133127516.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/soniventorum.com\/"}],"tags":["instrumental rock","music for performing art","music for film","film soundtrack","soundtrack","music for television","music for video","instrumental","music for podcast","new zealand","synth","analog synth","acoustic guitar","brazil","new england conservatory","new wave","alt rock","fun","00s","japan","female vocalist","mandolin","american","whimsical","alternative pop","germany","quirky","film","college rock","electroacoustic","brooklyn","crazy","kirk pearson","accordion","acoustic electronic","post punk","oberlin college","alternative rock","alternative","awesome","usa","electro folk","clever"]},{"album_id":"3455","album_title":"A Man Under The Influence","album_handle":"A_Man_Under_The_Influence","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Alejandro_Escovedo\/A_Man_Under_The_Influence\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Alejandro Escovedo","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Alejandro_Escovedo\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"2","album_listens":"3112","album_date_created":"6\/10\/2009 09:54:07 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Alejandro_Escovedo_-_A_Man_Under_The_Influence_-_2009113011804884.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"3087","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"3455","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Alejandro_Escovedo_-_A_Man_Under_The_Influence_-_2009113011804884.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A Man Under The Influence","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"13713","album_title":"A Million Ways","album_handle":"A_Million_Ways","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/1in10Varia\/A_Million_Ways\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"1in10\/Varia","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/1in10Varia\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><span id=\"nfo_enrmp291\">New mashup album by one member of Varia, you might remember them from their previous release at Enough Records, a double album titled <a href=\"http:\/\/enoughrecords.scene.org\/?cat=enrmp269\">Magic + Omega<\/a>.

But much of the  music that I have produced over the years is not  on CDs. Much was  created for Dance and Theater performances or as  exercises for my own  continual study and development. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">This compilation is not a  complete one. Some of the  music is lost, much is on cassette tapes and  computer hard drives that I  no longer am able to access. Some is of bad  audio quality and not  presentable. Some of the music is just too  personal to present right  now.<\/span><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">There is great  diversity of  ideas on these recordings. It is the diversity that gave me  the jolt to  want to share them.<\/span><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">I said to  myself, \"Cooper-Moore, do  you hear that? Wow man, what were you  thinking about when you wrote  that?\"<\/span><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">So I am trying to answer that question. Clarifying  queries,  taking stock in past creations in order to gather up and move  forward  into the future, and looking at what's been on my palate these  past 20  years, all seem to be what I am doing.<\/span><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">In thinking  \"Retrospective,\" looking back, I first  thought that it was something  that I didn't want to do. \"Look ahead,\" I  kept saying to myself. But  the realization came that it would be a good  thing to delve a little  into what I created in the past, into the when,  the why and with whom.  The voice kept speaking, \"It will bring clarity  to help you move  forward.\" <\/span><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">What have I learned? Small is Beautiful. \"The Forest\"  stands  alone and is complete. It needs nothing more. Less than one  minute long  it is one of the most beautiful things to come through me. I  put it in  my player and loop it over and over. I don't tire of it, but  go deeper  and deeper into my listening place and continue to be moved by  its  simplicity. <\/span><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><br style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\" \/><\/span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia, serif;\">The small form  rules here.

We leave them their original land, bound to take it back. \"It is also possible that part of our test of faith is our hating this world, even our flesh body, to the extent to be willing to leave it without any proof of the Next Level's existence\". The Comet came, and we're still here, trembling on a ship, sinking to the inner depths of the selves, while we endlessly argue about the Next Level to take us away. We sink, and we await for something to replenish our Here, uncaring of the tragedy bringing us back to the bottom of the oceans. \"They pushed him away and went back to grumbling about wages, and about blankets for women, and about the right to suck cocks, and about how the dog was treated. The ship kept sailing north, and after a while it was crushed between two icebergs and everyone drowned.\" Everyone drowned, and the few who noticed were taken aback by the Here.\u2028This was made before Andreas Breivik, this was made while we sailed north and hit an iceberg and drowned. This was made in front of Heaven's gate, in front of which lay the selfless bodies of souls who boarded on a craft, taking them back to their Father. They left and we remain here. Their ship the same we're on, only they've already gone, and we are still here, marching forward until the next iceberg will take us down. This is the best world possible, it's the only one. I brag about things, I brag about those who found the truth before us, and left with it forever. Glad to be together. Glad to be gone. \u2028At the same time I brag and laugh at them in this: SLP's YouTube Of Horros\u2028They were so stupid, I would say. How could they have believed? I would ask. YouTube is the next Bible. All the Words are there. All the inscriptions bearing images and sounds. A stream of consciousness no more, but a stream of videos, one after the other, one Truth after the other, equally right to exist, and equally right to be seen. I talk too much, and have so little, if any, to say. I spend nights to frenzy between testimonies of Cults that have faded, and pornography. I will see Satan one day, there, in the nights of frenzy when everything is equally right and every Truth is equally correct. As I drown in a ship of fools, me no different than the rest of the crew.<\/p>\n<p>Ted Kaczynski's \"Ship Of Fools\" text<\/p>\n<p>\u2028\"La Societ\u00e0 Industriale e il Suo Futuro\" ( italiano ), ( English ) , di Theodore J.

\/><br \/>Hi there. <br \/><br \/>After my previous minimal chiptune album - 2 channels only - I decided to make on my ZX Spectrum 48Kb something as developed as possible with the machine. I must admit I'm pretty proud to give you my the newest album containing 10 multichannel 1-bit chiptunes, having from 5 to 9 channels. <br \/><br \/>Original idea was to make 6-channels chiptunes playing from 2 synchronized Spectrums (3 channels from each ZX, using Special FX engine). <br \/>I managed to make 4 such songs but meanwhile it appeared that Shiru programmed several totally new BEEPER engines: they were highly powerful and capable of playing even NINE channels from a single ZX Spectrum 48K.<br \/><br \/>Therefore finally you can find here: <br \/>- 4 stereo songs made on two synchronized Spectrums (Special FX engine, 2 x 3 channels)<br \/>- 5 mono songs coming from a single Spectrum (Octode engine; 9 channels)<br \/>- 1 mono song coming from a single Spectrum (QChan engine, 5 channels). <br \/><br \/>Like I used to say, mostly I don't make actual chiptunes - I just make music on a soundchip. :) <br \/>Hence, generally this album is in art-rock style (called 'progressive rock' sometimes), because the most well-known gamesongs from 80s from Spectrum48 were kept in this genre, and they have been written mostly by Tim Follin.<br \/>Anyways. Because of that, I would like to dedicate my album to Tim Follin, as he was the best 1-bit musician on ZX Spectrum 48K in 80s. <br \/><br \/>Z80 chip can actually generate whichever sound however ZX fans prefer mostly the characteristic Follin's sound (hard to stand for other 8bit computers' users :) :) ) and because we have a lot of accessible channels, our chiptunes remind mostly something like a furious swarm of hornets or bees. ;) <br \/>Now you can guess where the title came from. ;) <br \/>And believe me, real ZX48 fans would have _never_ exchanged 'Z80 swarm' sound to anything else. :) <br \/><br \/>From the 'technical' side..<br \/>Normally 1-bit sound from ZX consists only of a square (more\/less) wave tone without any volumes, without any white noises - simply just beeps. However we use various software-synthesizers called \"sound engines\". Technical details about the engines are as follows: <br \/>- SpecialFX gives me 2 channels of tones + one track of drums. It is PWM-synthesis based (PulseWidthModulation) and it has various envelopes, setup of drums and 2 steps of volume: one channel is louder than another. With clever composing you can get even delays and echoes, which is normally impossible on 1bit sound. This engine keeps tempo perfectly, so I was able to synchronize two ZX Spectrums and have more channels + stereo. <br \/>- QChan gives 4 channels of tones + one track of drums. Its possibilities are in general similar to the above engine however it's more powerful because - except mentioned envelopes - it has almost twice more channels and also more steps of volume (16 - you can chose from them to place the volumes for every tone-channel). <br \/>- Octode is the most powerful 1-bit engine contemporary. It gives 8 channels of tones + one track of drums. 9 channels is a huge effort for Spectrum's Z80 CPU, so the engine can make detunes sometimes. It's not easy to compose music without false notes here, however it is possible. It has an additional feature - tunning command E5x. It changes the notes' frequency and can be used for achieving more interesting 'fat' instruments. I use it often as it gives me some slightly detuned pads, like from analogue synthesizers. <br \/><br \/>Huge thanks go to contemporary programmists making new 1-bit software (or hacking the old one) for ZX composing: Shiru, Ccowley, XXL, FrankT. <br \/>Also to the classic programmer - Jonathan 'Joffa' Smith (R.I.P.) - who designed Special FX engine. <br \/>********************************************************<br \/><br \/>Enjoy the swarm.\u00a0 <br \/>You have been stung. <br \/>MISTER BEEP<br \/>04.2011.<\/p>","album_date_released":"4\/29\/2011","album_comments":"1","album_favorites":"2","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"17481","album_date_created":"10\/04\/2011 07:40:31 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Mister_Beep_-_A_thousand_furious_bees_-_2011100474344772.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"16030","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"10193","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Mister_Beep_-_A_thousand_furious_bees_-_2011100474344772.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A thousand furious bees","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":["mister beep"]},{"album_id":"19908","album_title":"A thousand words","album_handle":"A_thousand_words","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Ulises_Lima\/A_thousand_words\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Ulises Lima","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Ulises_Lima\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":"1\/09\/2010","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"8","album_listens":"6017","album_date_created":"2\/11\/2016 06:43:49 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ulises_Lima_-_A_thousand_words_-_2016021154725988.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"32935","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"19908","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ulises_Lima_-_A_thousand_words_-_2016021154725988.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A thousand words","image_caption":"https:\/\/uliseslima.bandcamp.com","image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"13048","album_title":"A Trace","album_handle":"A_Trace","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Jan_Grnfeld\/A_Trace\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Jan Gr\u00fcnfeld","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Jan_Grnfeld\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The last four or five years I followed a trail.

Jess is quite prolific and equally skilled on guitar, keyboards and drums. <br \/><br \/>I had originally approached her to collect some of the songs she was posting there for a release here, but instead she offered up a self-released CD from 2003 called A Truly Fun Place, where she is responsible for (nearly) every sound on it. It has a wonderful loose, jazzy psychedelic vibe that could easily be mistaken for a long-lost early 70s private press LP.<br \/><br \/>You can hear more of her freaky-jazz creations under the name <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/be-a-waterwolf\">Be A Waterwolf<\/a> on soundcloud.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>LINER NOTES:<\/p>\n<div id=\"descript\">Tracks 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, & 12 recorded between 2002-03 at Transit Recordings by Alexander Boyes<br \/><br \/>Tracks 1, 4, 6, 9, & 11* recorded in Jess Lemont's trusty basement with a primitive digital multi-tracker that used a zip drive at various times, mostly the 2000-01 range.<br \/>*2nd half of track 11 was recorded at DV Productions in 2000 (David Vartanian). The last 20 seconds were recorded at Transit Recordings. Full-circle effort.<br \/><br \/>All music, lyrics and bad raps (bad raps are found on tracks 6 & 9) written and performed\/sung by Jess Lemont. Alexander Boyes is a guest singer (he does the low, low stuff on Blue Shadow, track 12, at the end. It is very low). Oh, he also played the cymbal rolls at the end of track 5.<br \/><br \/>Note: Original release contained the tracks 'Ducks that are Badasses' and 'No Cipher' -- unfortunately, it has been impossible to get them to transfer\/find copies. Ducks that are Badasses,' they really were. All of the ducks.<br \/><br \/>Second Note: Special thanks go out to Anja Sieger and to Anton Sieger for finding and transferring a serviceable copy of this first (really 2nd--I'm still looking for the 1st, from 1999 with the word 'Escapism' in the title, if anyone has that) album I put out. It seemed as though no one had a copy that mostly worked, and shame on me for not backing it up. Good job hanging onto things, Sieger siblings! Thank you. Also, 12 years later, I still would like to thank Alexander Boyes for being about as patient as anyone could be. Seriously. I tired people out.<br \/><br \/>Third Note: Quite a bit of Tracks 3 & 10 overlaid synth and then some guitar parts were tracked while Planet of the Apes and then part of Godzilla were playing, muted, on the television in the Transit Recordings facility, beyond the glass doors in the adjacent room. I observed. This was likely very helpful. Also, I now can only think of scenes from those movies when I hear both tracks.<\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>","album_date_released":"5\/05\/2015","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"12","album_listens":"41150","album_date_created":"5\/05\/2015 05:26:15 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Jess_Lemont_-_A_Truly_Fun_Place_-_20150505173541225.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"30205","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"18190","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Jess_Lemont_-_A_Truly_Fun_Place_-_20150505173541225.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: A Truly Fun Place","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"5945","album_title":"A Valentine for Jack Rose (2\/14\/10)","album_handle":"A_Valentine_for_Jack_Rose_21410","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Black_Twig_Pickers\/A_Valentine_for_Jack_Rose_21410\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Black Twig Pickers","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Black_Twig_Pickers\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"2","album_tracks":"5","album_listens":"24426","album_date_created":"3\/18\/2010 09:22:14 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Black_Twig_Pickers_-_A_Valentine_for_Jack_Rose_21410_-_20130101172957497.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"5443","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Luminocolor_-_20091220155347735.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/luminocolor"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"15669","album_title":"A Very Badgerland Christmas (2011)","album_handle":"A_Very_Badgerland_Christmas_2011","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Badgerland\/A_Very_Badgerland_Christmas_2011\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Badgerland","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Badgerland\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 14px;\">Badgerland's third instalment of Festive tunes.

Over the past few years Storm the Unpredictable has been staying busy performing at shows from coast to coast in the U.S., winning many songwriting competitions, artist of the year awards, and also releasing the vinyl series The 3 Piece, Extra Mumbo Vol. 1 and 2 along with his fellow crew members Priest da Nomad and Poemcees. Now in 2006, Storm the Unpredictable returns with Domination Recordings to release his new album \"A2: What Should Have Been\" featuring classic boom bap beats from The Unknown, Decompoze (DC), Brainstorm Sounds, C.

It is within Safeways' ice cream isles she wondered aimlessly in a dazed stupor for what may have been an eternity. Feeling bored, isolated and depressed Deborah would swallow all the cookies and candies she could get her hands on. But all the sweets in the world couldn't satisfy the deep and painful inner hunger of her soulless soul.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, Debbie was a sad hedonist, there's something almost Satanic about her yearning to be constantly filled with pleasure and love. She wants to feel the intensity of life and yet feels stuck in a role of a corporate puppet. Compulsively consuming \u00a0junk that will rot her teeth, her brain, heart, liver and soul.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Well, luckily, one day Little Debbie wondered away from her Safe little home in total confusion, out into the chaotic and scary \"big-wide world\". What followed was a serious of \u00a0queer, and almost psychedelic experiences that forced Debbie to turn her asshole and her brain inside out. Being the ultimate consumer of pleasure, she finally mind-fucked herself for good.<\/p>\n<p>The realization was intense as pain. Pain is pleasure, pleasure is pain. Can't have one with out the other. Thus BIG DEBBIE was born.<\/p>\n<p>This Miss is still far from a yoga Guru.

Both talented emcees\/deejays\/producers, the two sought to express with conviction their love and ability to fulfill all of these roles. This 16-track outing is dedicated to a wide array of music lovers. No two songs sound too closely the same, but no two aren't linked with the common thread of balance. You can catch either 22-year-old scratching, rhyming, comping, singing, or displaying their sample chops at any point on the disc. Standout tracks include, \"The Language\" where Dex and DT create an in-and-out pattern of a verse, completely from scratching their own vocals over a beat so fresh, it'll get you ready to hear more. \"Freeze\", \"Set Your Soul Free\" and \"Never All Ways\" give you a deeper look into the character of the duo over electrojazz instrumentation, and songs like \"Bigger Fish\", \"Get Yo Mind Right\", \"Read the Signs\" and \"The Monkey\" challenge the world around them. Of course, in the words of Marvin Gaye, \"you don't have to be told how groovy it is, or which tunes you should dig\".<\/p>\n<p>-from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dominationrec.com\/releases\/clan_destined_abracadamn.html\">Domination Recordings<\/a><\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"4","album_listens":"3193","album_date_created":"6\/03\/2009 12:25:07 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Clan_Destined_-_ABBRACADAMN_-_2009113012140225.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"2391","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Virus_-_2009113015851053.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":"Live 1984 LES","image_copyright":"\u00a9","image_source":"http:\/\/viewmorepics.myspace.com\/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&amp;friendID=137233632&amp;albumID=53"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"15175","album_title":"ABCD EP","album_handle":"ABCD_EP","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Ghost_Chief\/ABCD_EP\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Ghost Chief","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Ghost_Chief\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>ABCD EP was recorded from June 2012 - December 2012 with Jim Keaney at Devotion Recording.<\/p>\n<p>All percussion performed by Jim, Ted, Steve and Dan <br \/> <br \/> Guest Vocals : <br \/> \"Cincy\" : Ian Oliver (The Workout) <br \/> \"Dexterous\" : Dan Smith (Emma Ate the Lion) <br \/> \"Ethernaut\" : Buck Collings (Mr. Fyner and the Tech Ed Room) <br \/> <br \/> Special thanks to John Bell (JB) for the album artwork<\/p>","album_date_released":"3\/05\/2013","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"6","album_listens":"4673","album_date_created":"10\/04\/2013 08:10:25 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ghost_Chief_-_ABCD_EP_-_2013100481512209.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"25087","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"15175","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ghost_Chief_-_ABCD_EP_-_2013100481512209.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: ABCD EP","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":"artwork : John Bell (JB)","image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"11629","album_title":"ABCDEFG-HIJKLMNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ","album_handle":"Starring_-_Singles","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Starring\/Starring_-_Singles\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Starring","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Starring\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;font-size:12px;vertical-align:baseline;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height:16px;border-width:0px;padding:0px;\">Starring\u2019s\u00a0<strong style=\"vertical-align:baseline;background-color:transparent;border-width:0px;padding:0px;margin:0px;\"><em style=\"vertical-align:baseline;background-color:transparent;border-width:0px;padding:0px;margin:0px;\">ABCDEFG-HIJKLMNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0combines minimalist musical patterns with dreamy poetry to create a new style front-woman Clara Hunter likes to call \u201csparkle prog.\u201d It captures the frenetic energy of the band\u2019s live show, but here it is overlain with a new palate of synthesizers, delay effects, drum processing, aux percussion, and vocals that create delicate, but sometimes radical juxtapositions between the lyrical and the experimental.

Concretely, the album reflects an aesthetic that recalls the classic sounds of European prog rock (Magma, Faust, Neu!), the unhinged grit of 1970\u2019s New York no wave artists like Suicide, the earliest cuts from minimalists like Terry Riley and Philip Glass, and even a dose of post-rock\u2019s strung-out improvisations.<\/p>","album_date_released":"6\/12\/2012","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"2","album_listens":"3143","album_date_created":"5\/08\/2012 04:35:30 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Starring_-_ABCDEFG-HIJKLMNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ_-_20120509123207211.jpeg","album_images":[{"image_id":"15148","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Noctambulo_-_20110805165955743.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Noctambulo","image_caption":"Dimethyltryptamine E.P.

All of the tracks were written in 2010, well pretty much; \"Enlightenment\" started as a single phrase a few months earlier but was completed on Sunday 10th January in the dark. It stems from a plan to write a sci-fi themed EP; what better sci-fi to write about than <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Doctor Who<\/span>, and what story more suited to songform than Peter Davison's \"Enlightenment\"? The sci-fi idea is still percolating; expect more in the coming year. It's only a gentle thematic reference; the rest of the lyric a playing-around with amateur astronomical themes. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Sky At Night <\/span>is a great programme. Can't believe I didn't latch on sooner. The last bit recorded was Luke's flute solo, with its triple trill finale.<\/p>\n<p>We shoot forward to a transitional piece, \"All I Never Wanted\". We reckoned a little mood-shifter was necessary, and Bob's zither and cymbals did the rest. I think a collection of library music would be a good diversion for us, freed of the tyranny of lyrical narrative. You may beg to differ. Our long-suffering mixing program, Jeskola's Buzz (why am I writing that? It's the mixer, i.e. me, who suffers, bent-backed at the desk for hours trying to alchemise whilst everyone sleeps off their curry... woe, woe, woe) ...features a fabulous reverb plugin, Sonic Verb, crafted to resemble a pricey reverb of the early 00s, and which features on all the tracks on the EP. Here it's cranked up. I love the shiver-down-the-spine of the zither. Not sure if we can replicate it now Bob's bought a tuning key.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever hated your boss? Ah, but have you ever committed those thoughts to wax? Nor have we, but we did use our new-ish Korg D888 digital multitracker on this collection, and one of its first wriggling specimens was Bob's \"Below The Waves\" (Song For A Bastard Boss). A bluesy belch of bile, its instrumental break sees several badly-played quiet guitars going through a dozen effects boxes. I'm enjoying playing slide guitar these days. But oh! the luxury of recording the basic band track in the same room at the same time, with multiple mics on the drums.<\/p>\n<p>Sex tourism is go! \"Abysinnia Next Week\" began life as another song of Bob's called \"White Darth Vader\"; I picked out the underlying filth in its semi-nonsense lyrics and added some suitable lines. (The original synthpop version is still to come, on another EP, someday...) The backing track was mostly recorded in Exmouth at Luke's mum's house, where there is a great selection of recorders. Freak, man!<\/p>\n<p>After all that rampancy, you need a comedown, and here we have \"Fly By Night\". It has something to do with being persuaded to volunteer at an <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">adults'<\/span> charity ball, and having a miserable time. Rigsby comes to mind: \"The permissive society? It doesn't exist. And I should know - I've looked for it\". But of course, it needs to be looking <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">for you<\/span>. Listen out for a fierce and wonky guitar solo (ha!) and a fierce and wonky melodica (double ha!). This was the last thing recorded for the EP - we kept it standing around in the corner until December wearing only a simile.<\/p>\n<p>\"Wafternoon\" also hung around for a little while, until its silly lyric had infused through the music properly. It was prompted by a wobbly moment on the south coast. The middle section features two kazoos (never underestimate the kazoo), woozy slide from Luke and a kitschy keyboard solo by myself.<\/p>\n<p>It's reverb to 11 on the penultimate track, a riot of stereo percussion which includes coins spun on drum heads, a wind-up plastic robot, a wooden metronome, wall chimes, and a metal Beatles wall sign struck like a gong. It's named in honour of the daft comedian Marty Feldman, and nearly had the suffix \"Emergency Ambulance\". Imagine a fierce storm in an English village, trees coming down in people's gardens, slates sliding off roofs, and Marty riding through the sheeting rain, perhaps wiping the windscreen with a hanky when the wipers get stuck.<\/p>\n<p>We end the EP in solemn territory. Having first heard it after perusing Elena Filatova's Chernobyl photos, \"Son of a Systems Engineer Manager\" conveys such an air of weary resignation, that it's quite possible to believe Luke went and sabotaged a power station the following day. The protagonist's hopes are allowed to pick up briefly in the psychedelic middle 8, before coming back to the present with a distorted klaxon (having dozed off on the night shift?).

While reading\u00a0<em>The Politics of Indonesia<\/em>\u00a0by Dr Damien Kingsbury, Kesminas found himself continually referring to the index of abbreviations and acronyms\u00a0and it is this index that he chose as the basis for PUNKASILA\u2019s \"lyrics\". These acronyms became a set of abbreviated \"songs\" performed in a frenetic progressive-punk-rock idiom. The song titles are in fact the complete lyrics (with completed nomenclature echoed in\u00a0<em>Bahasa Indonesian<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;\" align=\"left\">Together\u00a0with the band, Kesminas\u00a0wrote 17 songs based on selected Indonesian acronyms and abbreviations. The genius of the<em>pancasila<\/em>\u00a0as propaganda, condensed through its motto, \"Unity in Diversity\", is to unify the wide ranging cultures of the Indonesian archipelago and to suggest that it is the five principles that they have shared in common since time immemorial. The concept that drives the Punkasila project is to distil the cacophony of disparate political, military, religious, cultural and bureaucratic organisations that constitute the Indonesian body politic to their abbreviated form of acronyms. It is hoped to make the songs both humorous and provocative in equal measure, in part by flattening out each organisations\u2019 implied agendas, arbitrarily presenting them alongside rival, non-affiliated or completely disconnected groups. In addition, many of these acronyms have been popularly inverted using\u00a0<em>plesetan<\/em>\u00a0as a kind of subversive double-speak. This specifically Indonesian wordplay\u00a0adds another layer of pathos and the ridiculous\u00a0to PUNKASILA\u2019s repertoire.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;\" align=\"left\">All the songs are original. The average length of each is about 1min 30sec with Kesminas singing the acronym repetitively and his co-vocalist Hahan\u00a0howling its complete form in\u00a0<em>Bahasa Indonesian<\/em>. Sometimes these roles are reversed.\u00a0The song writing\u00a0process\u00a0is all the more interesting given the\u00a0band members\u00a0very limited English and\u00a0Kesminas' non-existent Indonesian.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;\" align=\"left\">PUNKASILA\u2019S repertoire includes;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;\" align=\"left\"><br \/><strong>TNI<\/strong>: Tentara Nasional Indonesia (Indonesian National Military), Tikyan Ning Idab-Idabi (Poor but Adorable)<br \/><strong>PNU<\/strong>: Partai Nahdlatul Ummat (Islamic Community Awakening Party), Partai Nunut Udud (Party for Taking Cigarettes from your Friends)<br \/><strong>TURBA<\/strong>: Turun ke Bawah*, Turuk Babi (Down to Earth*, Pig's Vagina) *This was a leftist ideology of the 1950's and 60's for the political and cultural mobilisation of the populous.

Inefficient Screws tell the story of a young man's journey back to his past. The conglomerate of musicians around the songwriter Markus Steidl has grown into a small lo-fi living-room orchestra and recorded its sophomore album with an eleven-member cast, the core being comprised of Markus Steidl (vocals and acoustic guitar), Daniel Kroneberg (electric guitar, a.o. Likeartoise), Dirk L\u00fccken (bass) and Benjamin Arntz (ukulele and mandolin, a.o. Orchestre Miniature In The Park). The multi-instrumentalists Julia Kotowski (entertainment for the braindead) and Sebastian Arnold (mad scientist drummer) were also immensely involved in the recording process. Further strings and brass found their way onto this release through an online call. The record will be released through the indie label beeah-music on April 15, 2011.<\/p>","album_date_released":"4\/15\/2011","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"13","album_listens":"5267","album_date_created":"4\/15\/2011 05:50:21 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Inefficient_Screws_-_Advertitis_-_2011041561955314.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"13465","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"8991","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Inefficient_Screws_-_Advertitis_-_2011041561955314.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Advertitis","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.beeah-music.net\/media\/cover-inefficientscrews-advertitis-300dpi.jpg","image_order":"0"}],"tags":["lo-fi","orchestra","creativecommons","beeah","berlin","entertainmentforthebraindead","folk"]},{"album_id":"15118","album_title":"Advice","album_handle":"Advice","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Mported_Flows\/Advice\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Mported Flows","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Mported_Flows\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><strong>Want high-resolution album art, liner-notes or lossless FLAC audio? <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocsonic.com\/releases\/show\/advice\">Check out the blocSonic release page<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When not rocking the mic as one part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocsonic.com\/artist\/the-impossebulls\"><strong>The Impossebulls<\/strong><\/a> or as half of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocsonic.com\/artist\/twentyone-twentyfour\"><strong>Twenty-One: Twenty-Four<\/strong><\/a>, Pennsylvania based EMCEE <strong>Mported Flows<\/strong> delivers his own blend of boom bap hip-hop.

This first album features Aerologic's most popular tracks over the last three years, and features strong melodies, sizzling synthesizer stabs, warm chords and pumping beats. Aerologic burst onto the scene in 2011 with Ricochet. Since then, his uplifting progressive house sound has gone from strength to strength, bringing to Toucan Music anthemic original tracks such as Electronaut and Digital Nation as well as a variety of remixes for artists including JMD, Redmann and Marc Burt. Combining influences from classic trance with upfront pumping house, there are plenty of tracks on this compilation to get any dancefloor moving.<\/p>","album_date_released":"5\/16\/2016","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"10","album_listens":"17882","album_date_created":"5\/16\/2016 03:34:34 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Aerologic_-_Aerologic_-_20160516154905738.png","album_images":[{"image_id":"34001","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"20640","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Aerologic_-_Aerologic_-_20160516154905738.png","image_title":"Album Image: Aerologic","image_caption":"Aerologic","image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.toucanmusic.co.uk\/albums\/album.php?q=toulp7","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"19180","album_title":"Aeronaut","album_handle":"Aeronaut","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Blue_Dot_Sessions\/Aeronaut\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Blue Dot Sessions","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Blue_Dot_Sessions\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><strong>You can download and license the complete session for your project quickly and easily at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sessions.blue\/sessions\/aeronaut\">www.sessions.blue\/sessions\/aeronaut<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Driving and\u00a0triumphant, piano and guitar lead this album of thickly orchestrated chamber music.<\/p>","album_date_released":"10\/28\/2015","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"4","album_tracks":"6","album_listens":"46115","album_date_created":"10\/28\/2015 03:52:01 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Blue_Dot_Sessions_-_Aeronaut_-_20151028162256540.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"28607","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Nik_Snake_F_-_20141205172918911.png","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":"Nik Snake F","image_copyright":"Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA)","image_source":"http:\/\/cota303.net\/artist\/nik-snake-f\/7"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"3334","album_title":"Aeron\u00e1utica y otras tecnolog\u00edas","album_handle":"Aeronutica_y_otras_tecnologas","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Vate\/Aeronutica_y_otras_tecnologas\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Vate","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Vate\/","album_producer":"Vate","album_engineer":"Vate","album_information":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vate.com.mx\/discog\/aeronautica-y-otras-tecnologias\">http:\/\/www.vate.com.mx\/discog\/aeronautica-y-otras-tecnologias<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>This record it\u2019s a great journey into a Kraftwerk-like electro-world and beyond. You can see it in the music, but also in the names of compositions, cover design etc., all that epanage that makes listening to music more than just listening to music. You may feel an atmosphere of a naive, self-ironic belief in science and its importance in art. About the tunes:Aeron\u00e1utica I and II \u2013 ground control and airplane samples create real aero-atmosphere. Great tunes.PC Music \u2013 good, little drum\u2019n\u2019based piece but it sounds like an unfinished scetch of Kraftwerk\u2019s \u2018Computer world\u2019 remix.Circulo Polar \u2013 my favourite. Fabulous ambient ascetic mood that really reminds you of the Great White.Xalisko \u2013 Tel\u00e9fono \u2013 extremely transformed and somewhat experimental but it has this telephone rush in it, that makes the cut exciting.Shibari \u2013 not bad, but a little bland comparing to the rest of the album.\u201d<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/galaktycznyzwiad.blogspot.com\/2007\/09\/vate-diablo.html\"><strong>galaktycznyzwiad<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","album_date_released":"7\/01\/2001","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"14","album_listens":"4047","album_date_created":"6\/02\/2009 11:42:54 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Vate_-_Aeronutica_y_otras_tecnologas_-_2009113014219937.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"2957","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"3334","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Vate_-_Aeronutica_y_otras_tecnologas_-_2009113014219937.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Aeron\u00e1utica y otras tecnolog\u00edas","image_caption":"Cover","image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"1"},{"image_id":"2958","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"3334","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Vate_-_Aeronutica_y_otras_tecnologas_-_2009113014219294.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Aeron\u00e1utica y otras tecnolog\u00edas","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"2"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"7100","album_title":"Aesthetic Theory","album_handle":"Aesthetic_Theory_-_Pt_1","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Str8_Sounds_1098\/Aesthetic_Theory_-_Pt_1\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Str8 Sounds","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Str8_Sounds_1098\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"14","album_listens":"14307","album_date_created":"8\/13\/2010 08:24:08 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Str8_Sounds_-_Aesthetic_Theory_-_Pt_1_-_20100813233106200.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"9529","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"7100","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Str8_Sounds_-_Aesthetic_Theory_-_Pt_1_-_20100813233106200.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Aesthetic Theory - Pt. 1","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"20765","album_title":"Aesthetically Nebulous","album_handle":"Aesthetically_Nebulous","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Zreen_Toyz\/Aesthetically_Nebulous\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Zreen Toyz","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Zreen_Toyz\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.0px;\">The perception of aesthetic in art is a nebulous concept based on cultural specifics and individual interpretations.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\">So, from icebergs to telluric movements, the aesthetically nebulous path of this album is to immerse deeply in the clouds of sounds for discovering nebulous universes from beyond our introspective perception.<\/span><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;\"><span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.0px;\">Music Composed, Performed, and Produced by Zreen Toyz.

In celebration of this momentous occasion they have released a new record on a brand new label.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>Age of Energy is Chad Taylor and Rob Mazurek's sixth release as Chicago Underground Duo and the eleventh release in the Chicago Underground catalog. Finding time to get back in the studio was a challenge, as Rob has been touring with his trio Starlicker, The Sao Paulo Underground and the Exploding Star Orchestra and Chad with the Marc Ribot Trio, Side A (Ken Vandermark, Havaard Wiik) and Digital Primitives. The heavenly bodies even deigned to interrupt their plans to record, raining baseball-sized hailstones down like a plague upon the sessions. And yet, the Duo persevered against the cosmos to complete the new record over 4 days in Chicago with Todd Carter (TV Pow).\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>Developed during 2009 when the duo toured the east and west coasts, most of the material on the record was recorded live with very few overdubs.\u00a0\u00a0 Thematically, Age of Energy is concerned with the balance between controlled and uncontrolled experiences. Computers, keyboards and drum machines pulse alongside ancient instruments like the African Mbira. \u2018Winds and Sweeping Pines\u2019 opens with Chad and Rob playing synthesizers and electronics, gradually as the piece develops, Chad switches to drums and Rob switches to cornet and they improvise over a blistering bass vamp in classic Chicago Underground Duo style. \u2018It's Alright\u2019 is a piece making extensive use of electroacoustics, starting with a drone which incorporates extreme high and low frequencies. The electronics are overdriven with results of both known and unknown nature. \u2018Castle In Your Heart\u2019 is based on a traditional Shona song from Zimbabwe and constitutes the only\u00a0 acoustic composition. \u2018Age of Energy\u2019\u00a0 alternates between a 21\/8 and a 12\/8 rhythmic cycle over a dissonant pedal point.\u00a0 This track was also recorded live in the studio, without any overdubs.<br \/><\/p>","album_date_released":"3\/13\/2012","album_comments":"1","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"2986","album_date_created":"1\/20\/2012 03:05:42 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Chicago_Underground_Duo_-_Age_of_Energy_-_20120124124447654.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"17339","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"10896","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Chicago_Underground_Duo_-_Age_of_Energy_-_20120124124447654.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"13285","album_title":"Age of Feminine","album_handle":"Age_of_Feminine","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Kellee_Maize\/Age_of_Feminine\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Kellee Maize","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Kellee_Maize\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":"1\/08\/2007","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"3","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"23786","album_date_created":"1\/10\/2013 03:37:24 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kellee_Maize_-_Age_of_Feminine_-_20130110150758156.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"21934","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"13285","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kellee_Maize_-_Age_of_Feminine_-_20130110150758156.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Age of Feminine","image_caption":"Age of Feminine","image_copyright":"CC BY","image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"20158","album_title":"Age of Flowers","album_handle":"Age_of_Flowers","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Karissa_Hobbs\/Age_of_Flowers\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Karissa Hobbs","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Karissa_Hobbs\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":"11\/20\/2015","album_comments":"1","album_favorites":"3","album_tracks":"10","album_listens":"24987","album_date_created":"3\/18\/2016 12:26:42 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/img\/generic\/album-default-lp-transparent.png","album_images":[{"image_id":"30364","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Dorit_Chrysler_-_20150521121109146.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Dorit Chrysler","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"5237","album_title":"Agent Fresco -

I began by designing cover art for their digital single series. Among those digital singles were seven designed for Connecticut avante-garde power pop group, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/The-Scallions\/165438056370\"><strong>The Scallions<\/strong><\/a>, consisting of members <strong>Mike<\/strong> and <strong>Shawn Franklin<\/strong>. That eventually lead to me designing their <a href=\"http:\/\/slamjamz.com\">SLAMjamz<\/a> debut album <em>\u201cAgony Through Ceremony\u201d<\/em> in 2006. A year later I launched <strong>blocSonic<\/strong> and slowly molded it into the label it is today.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, I\u2019ve kept in touch with Shawn, though I kept my SLAMjamz and blocSonic worlds quite separate, so blocSonic wasn\u2019t on his radar. Then last year those worlds began merging with the release of Public Enemy producer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocsonic.com\/artist\/cdoc\"><strong>C-Doc\u2019s<\/strong> incredible music<\/a>. Those releases piqued Shawn\u2019s interest. He and I then began discussing options for bringing The Scallions music to blocSonic. We eventually decided that the best way to introduce them to blocSonic listeners would be via the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocsonic.com\/releases\/type\/xtended-editions\">Xtended Edition<\/a> re-release of the SLAMjamz album.<\/p>\n<p>So, with Chuck D\u2019s blessing I\u2019m very happy to introduce to you <em>\u201cAgony Through Ceremony XE\u201d<\/em>. This 3 disc collection is an incredible way for you to get to know the very talented Franklins. On disc 1 you\u2019ll find the complete original album along with extras. Disc 2 contains a unique new way to experience the album via commentary from the band along with more extras. Finally, disc 3 contains instrumental versions and still more extras!<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a long time Scallions fan discovering blocSonic for the first time or you\u2019re a long time blocSonic fan discovering The Scallions for the first time, this is going to be treat for your ears!<\/p>\n<p>A huge thank you to Chuck D for being down with this release and providing commentary!

Impeccably produced by Henk van der Duim, the songs are stripped to their bare essentials, making judicious use of the synths, tape loops, and treated pianos which bring them to life; rendering standouts like \u201cTwinkling\u201d and \u201cHeaven\u201d \u2014 both among the most conventional yet penetrating songs he\u2019s ever written \u2014 with soothing strength and assurance.<\/p>\n<p>Although this album is more acoustic and oriented towards somber, emotive songs laced with shimmering arrangments, Zero V still manages to set foot on the more ambient ground. Zero V produces original and interesting ambient music. The selections are quite long (\u201cNotch\u201d is over 11 minutes long) yet never get boring. It is to Zero V\u2019s credit that he can keep the listener interested for that long with this genre of music. Zero V uses instruments and sounds to create his own emotive ambient music. The short-wave samples, for example, add an eeriness in \u201cHiss\u201d, which adds to the overall sound of the piece. This music is not for every taste, but fans of Zero V and ambient music will find this to be a treat.<\/p>","album_date_released":"8\/14\/2006","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"9","album_listens":"109461","album_date_created":"11\/15\/2012 07:01:22

I got Kevin in there and with 3 crappy mics and we knocked this out live, went up to Boston and put it on Jonah\u2019s computer. Kevin was one of the shady guys around town. He would crash downstairs. I haven\u2019t seen him in 10 years but I heard he\u2019s well now. He wasn\u2019t then. Haha. This is one of the Massdist records where we thought \u201cthis could really work.\u201d Through a friend, Will Oldham got this cd and Kevin was asked to open for Palace with the potential of going on the tour opening up and recording with his brother, but in 1 wasted violent night it all got thrown down the toilet. Massdist \u2013 too raw for pro. Kevin\u2019s songs strike a chord with people. The lyrics are true. He was living the life. A very captivating person.

  new brand of heady, forward-thinking music that defies any easy reference. \n        After two full length releases (<i>Spacelaunch for Frenchie<\/i> \n        and 2001's critically acclaimed <i>Be Gentle With the Warm Turtle<\/i>), \n        the band caught the ear of Sub Pop \n        and have become the label's latest signing. As luck would have it, Strange \n        Attractors was asked to help bring the vinyl version to life. We are extremely \n        proud to release the double LP format of <i>Airs Above Your Station<\/i>, \n        Kinski's massive, genre-bending third album. <\/font><\/p>\n      <p><font size=\"1\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><i>Airs \n        Above Your Station<\/i> is by far Kinski's grandest acheievement. \n        Cresting a frothy wave marrying textured ambient drone, space-gaze sonic \n        swells, death-defying volume dynamics and melodic, lysergic guitar riffs \n        with balanced precision, <i>Airs Above Your Station<\/i> takes Kinski's \n        own interpretation of psychedelic rock a giant leap farther into the outer \n        reaches of orbit. Every song is dynamic, monumental, HUGE, composed to \n        seemingly be their last. From the opening warm drones of \"Steve's Basement\", \n        percolating gently towards a rendezvous with fat &amp; heavy acid-punk chords, \n         <i>Airs Above Your Station<\/i> makes an ecstatic trajectory across \n        a variety of textures, alternating between pillowing sonic passages doused \n        in effects and pummeling, bowel-wrenching volume. No other compositional \n        rock band makes the leap between 70's cosmic like Cluster and Brian \n        Eno, classic innovators like Loop and My Bloody Valentine, \n        to today's crop of dynamos like Mogwai and Bardo Pond with \n        such skill and originality. <\/font><\/p>\n      <p><font size=\"1\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">Kinski \n        have constructed an album of fantastic depth and detail, with material \n        so utterly epic, it easily reaches far beyond anything this band has released \n        to date.<\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">-<a href=\"http:\/\/www.strange-attractors.com\/catalog\/saah012.html\">Strange Attractors<\/a><br \/><\/font><\/p>","album_date_released":"1\/21\/2003","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"1236","album_date_created":"10\/15\/2009 11:38:54 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kinski_-_Airs_Above_Your_Station_-_2009113012900230.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"4609","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"4469","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kinski_-_Airs_Above_Your_Station_-_2009113012900230.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":"Kinski - Airs Above Your Station","image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.strange-attractors.com\/catalog\/saah012.html","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"15103","album_title":"Aislinn","album_handle":"Aislinn","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Aislinn\/Aislinn\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Aislinn","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Aislinn\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"2","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"140731","album_date_created":"9\/24\/2013 12:26:21 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Aislinn_-_Aislinn_-_2013092533708346.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"21642","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Matanza_-_20121223222725883.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Matanza","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"9008","album_title":"Ajaton Vie","album_handle":"Ajaton_Vie","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/AAN\/Ajaton_Vie\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Aan","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/AAN\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Recorded June 2007 in Helsinki, by J.Koho &amp; Jani Hirvonen with help of Veli-Matti Ik\u00e4valko (Kutomo).

For the rest of y'all: ONO is a unit of transcendent noise-making now in its <strong><em>fourth decade<\/em><\/strong>. Both notorious and neglected in their early years, ONO's unholy bitches' brew of noisy snarl, avant-garde R&B, gospel-heavy blackness, queer sensibility and extravagant, performance-art theatrics (they once played a concert at Navy Pier in which singer travis was dragged through the audience in a steel cage, naked but for a jockstrap) was in a whole 'nuther galaxy from the macho Chicago punk scene that spawned them. <br \/> Reemerging in the late 00s with astonishing vehemence and an expansive, multi-generational lineup, they've been embraced by a more fertile and experimental Chicago scene, and are about to explode skulls internationally.\u00a0travis has always referred to fellow-founder P. Michael ONO as the 'leader of the band,' but <em>anchor<\/em> might be more appropriate\u2014P. Michael's groundswelling bass and nasty, insectoid beats are unquestionably the glue that binds the sprawling noise. But then there's travis, whose fierce brilliance carries echoes of punk prophets like <strong>Patti Smith<\/strong>, <strong>Iggy Pop<\/strong> and <strong>Gil Scott-Heron<\/strong> but is always pure, raging ONO. As for the rest of the band, check the sick, <strong>Beefheartian<\/strong> groove of <em>Veil<\/em>, or their revelatory cover of the <strong>Velvet Underground's<\/strong> <em>All Tomorrow's Parties,<\/em> which manages to excise much of the song's innate sentimentality while upping its sonic generosity, the wall-of-sound sprouting weeds and flowers in its cracks. ONO's original mission statement (1980) runs through this music more truly and deeply than ever, so to quote it in full and let it speak for itself: <strong><em>ONO1980\/\/ Experimental Performance, NOISE, and<\/em><\/strong> <em><strong>Industrial Poetry Performance Band; Exploring Gospel's Darkest Conflicts, Tragedies and Premises<\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>","album_date_released":"10\/31\/2012","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"2","album_listens":"4890","album_date_created":"9\/17\/2012 04:53:07 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/ONO_-_Albino_-_20120917170256209.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"20419","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"12459","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/ONO_-_Albino_-_20120917170256209.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Albino","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"5044","album_title":"Albino Ghost Monkey Live at Blipfest 09","album_handle":"Albino_Ghost_Monkey_Live_at_Blipfest_09","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Albino_Ghost_Monkey\/Albino_Ghost_Monkey_Live_at_Blipfest_09\/","album_type":"Live Performance","artist_name":"Albino Ghost Monkey","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Albino_Ghost_Monkey\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Albino Ghost Monkey performs live at the fourth-annual Blip Festival. <br \/><\/p><p>Dec 17, 2009<\/p><p>@ The Bell House in Brooklyn NY<\/p><p> with visuals by Outpt<\/p><p>Setlist: 1.Regardless 2.When 3.Moment 4.Last Chance 5.Revisiting 6.Contrast 7.Dynamite Brother 8.Detach. 9.Goodbye<\/p><p>hosted by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Tank\" href=\"http:\/\/thetanknyc.org\">The Tank<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"FMA label page\" href=\"\/label\/8bitpeoples\">8bitpeoples<\/a><br \/><\/p><p><i>Artist Bio - Created in late 2006, Albino Ghost Monkey (a.k.a.

The album has twelve super catchy pop songs that showcase Roman\u00b9s forceful vocals alongside the jangled-out guitars, lush harmonies and an exceptional rhythm section. The Oranges Band cites influences as varied as Guided By Voices, Elvis Costello, Brian Eno, Television and Velvet Underground in the creation of their sound. The undeniable hooks and soaring guitars also evoke 60's girl-group pop and mod bands like The Jam and Joe Jackson. (CD version being released on Lookout!

With musical influences as divergent as classic country and 1970s era pop, you might imagine something like Bakersfield-Bread. Mmm...yes. Yet, in spite of a flavor that certainly ruminates, this doesn't quite sum up the paradoxically spare albeit lush sound of these guitar-based arrangements. Notwithstanding the occasional touch of telecaster-inspired twang and a few train-roll rhythms, the music on this debut release is more cosmic than country, calling on the subtle effects of atmosphere to soften an otherwise dark airing of views. <br \/><br \/><br \/>From the sweetly seductive \"Honey Mead\" with it's boozy swing to the Queen influenced pomp of \"Tongue Tied,\" Paper Navy aim to persuade a diverse audience that pop isn't so easily classified, and folk is more of an ethic than an aesthetic. This idea can also be heard on tunes like \"Swan Song,\" \"Factories,\" and the title track, \"All Grown Up,\" which delve into the existential misgivings of Everyman while remaining pleasantly listenable and catchy enough to hold on to. <br \/><br \/><br \/>This project was recorded in a ramshackle rehearsal space (that also serves as a laundry room) by Shawn Anfinson (vocals, acoustic guitar), Brandon Harris (guitars, bass) and Simon Lynn (drums, bells). They are now joined by Jim Elrod (bass), and Jeff Weems (keys).<\/p>","album_date_released":"4\/01\/2009","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"3","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"42968","album_date_created":"1\/04\/2010 09:14:08 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Paer_Navy_-_All_Grown_Up_-_20100104201219004.png","album_images":[{"image_id":"4311","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Sunset_Rubdown_-_2009113015607949.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":"Sunset Rubdown @ Debaser, Malm\u00f6 - September 3, 2009 ","image_copyright":"Photo by popponny","image_source":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/29004009@N03\/3889070293\/"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"18140","album_title":"All I Have","album_handle":"All_I_Have","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/REKchampa\/All_I_Have\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"REKchampa","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/REKchampa\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>\"The latest club drug coming out of Atlanta goes by the street name REKchampa.

Indeed, so unresponsive does the user become that his or her body may actually begin exhibiting rigor mortis. Remarkably, and for reasons not yet fully understood, despite (or perhaps because of) this stiffness, the body will then resume its rhythmic spasms and continue to twitch ad infinitum.

Henriksen has crafted his music nicely in that vein, making delicate folk songs and producing them to perfection on this album, All the Learning, the first new release from Holy Page since spring and proprietor Christian Filardo's newest release in the epic unfolding of his moniker, Good Amount. He also writes of All the Learning, 'As light fades the echo of the day rings out through the night and the quiet sets in. A heavy thought represented in the lightest way'. That is this album, at times dolorous in its passage, but always engrossing for the precocious completion of his ballads through technical mediation.

While one tradition calls joyfully  to Michael to row the boat ashore, another speaks to the simple  tragedies of a nation at birth. Look and you'll find them: dust bowl  ballads, mortality meditations, strange and sweet melodies born of  hardship and sacrifice. In this song, a slave mother who can't care for  her own infant sings the master's fractious child to sleep... a child,  of course, who only pines for his own mother.<\/p>\n<p>Falling asleep can feel like death. In it we disappear, we lose  control, exhausted. The process is not always restful. Is it, as James  put it to me the other day, a threat of eradication? Why else do  children who hear the \"bed-time\" call run from their parents? And why do  grown insomniacs stare at the ceiling, unable to relinquish the day,  give in and let go? We soothe our children, and sometimes at night we  must soothe ourselves. Sometimes, as here, we do it with promises of  heaven. But the world waits, the next great fear lurks, tomorrow's  troubles wait patiently within tomorrow for us to find. I myself can  only sleep lightly, treading the surface. I know this world of beauty  and horrors has more time than I do. <em>--Anne DeAcetis<\/em><\/p>","album_date_released":"6\/29\/2010","album_comments":"2","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"1114","album_date_created":"6\/29\/2010 03:40:40 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Three_Is_a_Green_Crown_-_All_the_Pretty_Horses_-_2010062973655659.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"8775","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"6707","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Three_Is_a_Green_Crown_-_All_the_Pretty_Horses_-_2010062973655659.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: All the Pretty Horses","image_caption":"\"All the Pretty Horses\" (WBR 36)","image_copyright":"Michelle Orsi Gordon","image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"21039","album_title":"All The Wild Creatures","album_handle":"All_The_Wild_Creatures","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Scott_Nice\/All_The_Wild_Creatures\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Scott Nice","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Scott_Nice\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":"1\/01\/2016","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"10","album_listens":"23032","album_date_created":"7\/07\/2016 09:03:20 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Scott_Nice_-_All_The_Wild_Creatures_-_20160707211654320.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"34619","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"21039","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Scott_Nice_-_All_The_Wild_Creatures_-_20160707211654320.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: All The Wild Creatures","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"16811","album_title":"All These Simple Things","album_handle":"All_These_Simple_Things","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Lee_Rosevere\/All_These_Simple_Things\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Lee Rosevere","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Lee_Rosevere\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>After completing my over-the-top conceptual space prog-rock album <em>Lion on the Beach<\/em> (by the <a href=\"https:\/\/electricamygdala.bandcamp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Amygdala<\/a>), I wanted to write new material, but this time approach it in the exact opposite manner.<br \/><br \/>I limited myself instrumentally to solo piano (which ended being augmented by strings on a few tracks) and deliberately tried to compose as simply as possible.

After a two-years experience with the band De Seekas, a band with a stoner-rock attitude, the two guys began to deal with Howard, a piano from the beginning of the century, which drives them to turn letterally upside-down their style and name.<br \/>\u201cAlle basi della Roncola\u201d (At the feet of the Roncola) is the title of their debut album as Sakee Sed, coloured and dark at the same time, compact and multifaceted but of great impact. The album contains 13 tracks that blend a sense of lightness with paranoia, friendship and hate, fairy and frenzy, everything hanging by a grey rural dimension and a coloured world soaked in LSD.<br \/>Old and vintage instruments, very simple and low-fi recording characterize the album. On the Howard\u2019s tunes and on a dancing drumming, we find ourselves catapulted back to the old saloons of the 50s and we can even smell tobacco. Everything is surrounded by harmonies of acoustic and electric guitars, vibraphones, banjo, ukulele, horgans, basses, chorus, melted with Marco, just awake, voice.<br \/>Puns, metaphores and allusions characterize the lyrics.

It's almost like a \"back tot the past\" trip listening to these tracks. Happy Elf knows exactly how to create the atmosphere of eighties popmusic, because he plays all instruments by hand and doesn't use a computer (o.k. a drumcomputer). The voice of Happy Elf makes every track complete and makes you wonder why only beautiful and crafted singers dominate the popmusic market. Happy Elf brings you back to reality and shows you the real world which is full of loneliness, sex, doubt , confusion and love. This is the third Happy Elf release on WM Recordings.

Since their inception in 1996 and over the course of seven \n        full-length albums, the San Francisco-based quartet have spun a web of \n        dynamically textured trip-scapes induced almost entirely from total improvisation, \n        drawing a torrent of praise in the process. Live they are a force to be \n        reckoned with, a spontaneous combustion of tremendous power fueled by \n        intense volume and crystalline dissonance. Every one of their recordings \n        display a steady evolution in their unique brand of improvised drone rock, \n        with each one exploring a myriad of different textures. For their eighth \n        album, the band has honed their craft into a finely sharpened prism, a \n        record aimed for your gut as well as your head. <i>Also Rising<\/i> \n        is the new revelatory oracle, the band's most powerful, focused and simply \n        finest recording to date. <\/font><\/p>\n      <p><font size=\"1\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">Initially \n        conceived as a band exploring psychedelic terrain from on-the-spot creation, \n         <i>Also Rising<\/i> stands apart as SubArachnoid Space's \n        most composed record. Much of the band's output charts effects-laden acid-rock\/drone \n        via telepathic interplay, but this time SubArachnoid Space hone \n        ideas crafted from the depths of improvisation to a set of razor-sharp \n        songs that stick with your brain receptors, refusing to leave. The result \n        retains all the magic of their full-blown flights of fancy, but with a \n        solid punch that will leave your mind and body reeling. Armed to the cerebellum \n        with effects-drenched twin guitars, bowel-rumbling bass and propulsive, \n        complex drumming, SubArachnoid Space get the acid test rolling \n        with \"Harsh Facts of Life\"; stun-gun guitars omit phaser-like drones, \n        inducing a propulsive, percussive line that teases the bass into melody, \n        bleeding into a dark stoner-rock groove for the guitars to play lazer-tag \n        over. <i>Also Rising <\/i>weaves and bobs onward across a dense \n        and varied landscape, alternating between aggressive neuronal meltdowns \n        and chiming, glistening corridors. Ending with the blissful catharsis \n        of \"Tigris\" (a truncated, fine-tuned version of the side-long opus opposite \n        Bardo Pond on the split LP they shared on Camera Obscura \n        last year), the comedown is a total psychic purge leaving your brain quivering. \n        <\/font><\/p>\n      <p><font size=\"1\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">Traversing \n        the acid-jam rhythmic grooves of Meddle-era Pink Floyd, the subconscious \n        stirrings of the Cosmic Jokers, and seasoning the sonics with the \n        free-skree guitar aviation of Magnog or Skullflower, <i>Also \n        Rising<\/i> is a flooring dictum in SubArachnoid Space's mind \n        expansion campaign. May it hotwire your headspace accordingly. <\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\" face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">-<a href=\"http:\/\/www.strange-attractors.com\/catalog\/saah013.html\">Strange Attractors<\/a><br \/><\/font><\/p>","album_date_released":"4\/08\/2003","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"2","album_listens":"866","album_date_created":"10\/16\/2009 01:14:13 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Subarachnoid_Space_-_Also_Rising_-_2009113013806853.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"4719","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"4491","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Subarachnoid_Space_-_Also_Rising_-_2009113013806853.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":"SubArachnoid Space - Also Rising","image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.strange-attractors.com\/catalog\/saah013.html","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"19226","album_title":"Alt er vigtigt","album_handle":"Alt_er_vigtigt","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Strosaurus\/Alt_er_vigtigt\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"St\u00e6rosaurus","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Strosaurus\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Le duo danois St\u00e6rosaurus nous a offert il y a bient\u00f4t 3 ans un EP 5 titres sublime.

Rezultatul este un amestec interesant de beaturi sacadate, elemente ambientale, acorduri de soul si basi grei cu intriga subtila. Piesele nu se bat pentru toata atentia ascultatorului dar nici nu il lasa sa pluteasca in deriva propriilor ganduri.

Fat Worm\u2019s ninth release unstitches pop itself and expertly drapes it in drool. From common instruments: guitar, drum, vocal, and bass comes a crowd of unlabored sounds, surging on burnt Bambi legs, a melting forest of crisscross gone limp, crashing over and again into perfect place. It\u2019d be dumb luck, except it never quits.<br \/><br \/>Singing, which ruins so many a band, is for Fat Worm the insane face atop the hulking freak. It belongs there, blurting in sardonic falsetto that careens high then higher into dentist drill register. Drums get up in the way of ten flailing limbs, guitar buzzsaws timbres stirring up a magnetic dust that seems to steer itself. Grab on!

The heartland music known as Americana \u2013 for lack of a better term \u2013 meets up here with an eager partner in the form of improvisation.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As a definitive missive of social protest, the opening track presents the only vocals on the record: a cry for justice (\u201cAmerica, do you think about the lives that you have stolen?\u201d) followed by a statement of return (\u201cAmerica, we\u2019re gonna put you on the homeward bound train\u201d). Cooper-Moore sings and plays the diddley bow (a rumbling bass instrument with a percussive attack) while Assif Tsahar adds intermittent cries on tenor saxophone. The loping shuffle has a catchy groove which works as a complement for Tsahar\u2019s shrill blowing, together laying out the emotional themes to which the duo will refer through the course of<em>America.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Tsahar, whose reeds are familiar in out jazz circles for their energy and timbral range, takes multiple opportunities here to amble along the relative straight and narrow. The aptly titled \u201cBack Porch Chill\u201d offers a relaxed country blues, as does \u201cBeyond The Years\u201d; the two pieces identically entitled \u201cLament For Trees\u201d unfold as sparse, open ballads with gentle overtones of swing. None of these tunes would work without Cooper-Moore\u2019s thoroughly grounded, organic playing on banjo, piano, mouth bow, and diddley-bow. Cooper-Moore has never been one for the spotlight and his obvious humility serves this project well.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>But lest you get too comfortable,\u00a0<em>America<\/em>\u00a0shoots some fiery sparks as well. \u201c12th Avenue Messengers\u201d juxtaposes Tsahar\u2019s overblown, emotional horn alongside punchy drums and cymbal. It\u2019s a pointed and binding reminder of the record\u2019s message. \u201cWounded Knee\u201d opens up in a similarly edgy, forward vein. Cooper-Moore, for all of his work on the folksy instruments, is in his true element on the piano, which he hammers mercilessly in swirls around Tsahar. Following an extended open stretch, both players close out the record with another emphatic blast.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For its open candor and unforced message,\u00a0<em>America<\/em>\u00a0is a near masterpiece. It\u2019s most certainly not for the faint of heart, despite a generally friendly feel, but that\u2019s all part of the message. This is unequivocally one of the finest records to emerge this year. (Even though friendly critics everywhere have assembled their lists before they even had a chance to hear the disc. Their loss, not yours, at least in this case.)<\/p>\n<p>~\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:njacobson@allaboutjazz.com\">Nils Jacobson<\/a><\/p>","album_date_released":"8\/06\/2003","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"3","album_listens":"10358","album_date_created":"9\/18\/2011 11:14:30 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Digital_Primitives_-_America_-_20110918112005449.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"15844","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"10077","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Digital_Primitives_-_America_-_20110918112005449.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: America","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"},{"image_id":"15965","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"10077","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Digital_Primitives_-_America_-_2011092894118977.JPG","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":["digital primitives","assif tsahar"]},{"album_id":"11552","album_title":"American Dream (Featuring TD)","album_handle":"American_Dream_Featuring_TD","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Tab\/American_Dream_Featuring_TD\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Tab","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Tab\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>I hope you enjoyed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocsonic.com\/releases\/show\/afterthought\">Tab\u2019s \u201cAfterThought\u201d<\/a> which we dropped last week.

They tell stories with words, field recording collages and instruments. Carsten Vollmer takes their recordings and cut them in pieces. The result is the pure sound of the noise of a radio transmission.<\/p>\n<ol><li><strong>The Edge Of The World<\/strong>\u00a0<br \/>Vollmer\u2019s samples introduce the sounds of swamps alongside the Mississippi and a crowd at Preservation Hall, New Orleans. There\u2019s the tune \u2018Robert E Lee\u2019 \u2013 a classic from the American songbook \u2013 played on the calliope, a steam whistle used to draw crowds to the Mississippi paddle steamers, and lorries going past on Highway 61, the blues highway up to Memphis.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dempester Highway\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>Opens with the sound of the Mississippi lapping against the banks of the river in St Louis and a lovely piano phrase from Boz Hayward. More Vollmer samples mix with freight trains and gravel from the Stovall plantation in Clarksdale in this lament for a love lost on Alaska\u2019s remote but beautiful Dempster Highway. Keep on rolling, Dempster Highway<\/li>\n<li><strong>Recording Of Her Voice\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>A story considering what we have left when people move on. Lost voices replayed have an eerie quality, while cheery postmen stuff bills through our doors and life goes on. The Chicago subway meets the paddle steamer\u2019s calliope while those words take on an importance and symbolism far beyond the original intention. Some people have answerphone message transferred onto tape, because that\u2019s all they have left of their loved ones.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>For this recording, PURE SOUND are:<\/p>\n<p>Vince Hunt: Bass, tapes, vocals<br \/>Boz Hayward: Piano<br \/>Simon Price: Spoken word<br \/>Sheona Drummond: Spoken word<\/p>\n<h3>about the record<\/h3>\n<p>PURE SOUND vs VOLLMER came about when Carsten Vollmer suggested we sample each other\u2019s work and write new material from that. I knew how direct and uncompromising Carsten\u2019s work was and thought the collaboration would highlight huge contrasts in the way artists approach each other\u2019s work. I was curious to see what he might do with Pure Sound songs too \u2013 you couldn\u2019t get much more different!<\/p>\n<p>Working as Pure Sound I gather found sounds to build a soundtrack for lyrics, bass lines and piano melodies. When Carsten sent me his 7\u201d singles this gave me a number of ideas of samples I might take. I work in Pro Tools so I selected some cuts but then had to go to America for work.<\/p>\n<p>In America I gathered more sounds and stored them alongside the Vollmer samples. When I looked at the project again on my return, suddenly things started to happen. The Vollmer samples started to work with a mic check by a blues singer in Vicksburg and the sound of a swamp running alongside the Mississippi. Once I had a start, the rest was easy.<\/p>\n<p>This collaboration features the Pure Sound AMERICAN TRILOGY, three tracks using found sounds gathered while main songwriter VINCE HUNT was in the United States in 2008 and made with samples taken from Carsten VOLLMER\u2019s vinyl catalogue. Once finished the songs were sent to Carsten VOLLMER for his interpretation with his unique approach to music.<\/p>\n<h5>the american trilogy<\/h5>\n<p>These are the sounds of New Orleans, Chicago, Vicksburg, Minneapolis and St Louis mixed up and fed into songs penned on the road by Hunt. They feature the sounds of boats on the Mississippi, the calliope steam whistle from paddle steamers in New Orleans; freight trains going through Hannibal, Missouri; the Chicago subway and the gravel under car wheels from the Stovall Plantation, where blues guitarist Muddy Waters grew up.<\/p>\n<p>These three songs are observations on life, love and relationships; on what we do with our time on this earth.<\/p>\n<h5>the lyrics<\/h5>\n<p><em>Edge of the World<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone else has what they want, while my face is twisted against the bitter wind of disappointment<br \/>Destiny called me. Pulled on my vest and hat and climbed aboard that ship. I went to the edge of the world, and didn\u2019t think about it.<br \/>At the edge of the world the cliffs are rocky and brown. The wind is strong. It\u2019s a long way down.<br \/>I think of a friend who walked into the propellers of an aircraft. And the polar bear who, with nothing else for miles around, fell for the old rifle trap.<br \/>Dipping fingers in the Berents Sea<br \/>So cold I have to rub them to bring back any warmth<br \/>It\u2019s like shaking hands with a frozen friend<br \/>Those same fingers hold your hand at 3am<br \/>I have no control over what\u2019s in my life<br \/>My footprint in some faraway place.

Two crop spraying planes beside the highway<br \/>A flash of sun, and we were gone<br \/>Recordings of her voice. That\u2019s all I have left. I have no other evidence. I would turn the world upside down to hear her say those words again.<br \/>I wrote the words that she speaks, those words are all I have left.\u00a0<br \/>They\u2019re diamonds from a different time, when we didn\u2019t realise how important they would be.

And who will take care of these tears?<br \/>A postman with a cheery smile stuffs letters through my door. But inside my house I hear her voice, downstairs.\u00a0<br \/>I should be tucked up against the rain, doing what I\u2019m doing. But instead I\u2019m playing recordings of her voice, again and again.<br \/>Only a matter of seconds, only a couple of words. But the recordings of her voice are all I have, and all I have left.<br \/>She was a bird that flew south, an angel that grew wings: a ship that slipped out of the harbour one dark night.

several occasions, \"when I first learned to write songs, every song was good and perfect. \u00a0Each had verses, choruses, hooks, and they were all funny and memorable. They were like that because I wouldn't recognize anything as good or even as a song until it fit those categories. \u00a0Over time I learned that songs do not need any of those things to be good, and many of those good qualities are in fact bad. \u00a0That is why so many of my songs seem so bad now, because they are actually transcendently good.\"<\/p>\n<p>OMD meets OMFG and LMFAO meets STFU in UCUG's Post-Doctorate third year release, (inzert whatever the title is here), a coral of wild hits that no stable could ever hope to contain. \u00a0But there is no need for to contain. \u00a0They are herewithfor unto you and your mobile downloadables.<\/p>\n<p>The cloud-based LP configuration begins with The Man Who Licked The World, clearly referencing a Bowie song which is better than it. \u00a0The tracks strange mix is attributed to Ujam, an online program where you sing at your computer and it constructs the song around the vocal line for you. \u00a0UCUG has worked with better producers, but hey, the price is right, if you know what I'm saying. \u00a0There are in fact 4 Ujam tracks on UCUG's Allegorical Breakdance online configuration of electronic files, can you guess which ones they are?!?! \u00a0Here's a hint: most of the songs herein are of an intolerable length, but not all...<\/p>\n<p>Next is \"Carpe Deus; The Umpire Bites Back\" a title based on a drunken retelling of \"The Dead Poets Society,\" \u00a0which was confused with \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Star Wars\" at different points in the conversation. \u00a0This song is proof of the longstanding theory that one can hear the phrase, \"Invoke The Devil\" within a single song an infinite number of times, and it never loses its Zing. \u00a0This liner-note author is going to relisten to said track again now. \"Invoke the Devil\" \u00a0You pretty much can blow out your eardrums if you listen to this song any louder than 3 on your receiver.<\/p>\n<p>Gangrene Dream is sort of an angry fit the musician had while imagining what would happen if Vangelis and Tangerine Dream got in a knife fight, and Michael Claude Jarre had served as witness, later turning it into a lasershow.<\/p>\n<p>Life is The Worst. \u00a0Sometimes it feels this way, don't you think? \u00a0Baby Love was a good song, but the title on it's own might skeeve you out.<\/p>\n<p>Where's track number 5? \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Track 6 is an electronic thing done online, an argument both for an against same. \u00a0What is the fabric of your days? \u00a0I wonder? \u00a0Mine is linen, because of all the flax I eat. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Where's track number 7? \u00a05 and 7 missing? \u00a0Now that's odd. Shoot it was rilly trill, whatever that means. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Track 8 is some lute sample mac provides with it's basic suite of programs, and their \"EDM\" suite of midi instrument files. This song speaks to the cruelty indemic to the unlearning proccess. \u00a0IT AINT NICE, BUT IT WORKS. Uh oh, more instrumentals without instruments. \u00a0I guess you'd just call them mentals. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Trembling is somekind of neclassical meditation on bruce hornsby or something. \u00a0It is pretty all right. \u00a0Unlearny called it \"Eric Satie crushes sixteen Bruce Hornsbys under the wheels of his steampunk monster truck\" \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Ewok thing, I like it. \u00a0It is scary and cute. \u00a0Seems like it should credit phil glass somewhere, but I can't find any such credit. \u00a0Limitation is the sincerest form of something. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Tubs of it out black. \u00a0Called by some \"The scariest soundtrack to a romantic comedy ever written.\" \u00a0You ever see \"The Life of Brian?\" \u00a0It's funny. \u00a0I should mention at this point that each track is dedicated to a specific brainwave frequency, meant to turn 34% of listeners into slack-jawed, UCUG worshippers, or door injecting marijuana freebasers.<\/p>\n<p>Ugh, more later, I'm entering the Thetawave segment of the lp.<\/p>\n<p>Okay wait a second here, where is track 12? \u00a0That pulled the whole thing together! \u00a0This is madness!<\/p>\n<p>In the space where The Eurythmics meet cardiac arrhythmia, where Jesus Christ why the fuck won't those dogs shut the hell up?<\/p>\n<p>The 4 axis CNC machine used on this album was programmed by the poutiest soprano of the now-embattled Vienna Poochy-Lipped Boys Choir.<\/p>\n<p>This summer, the members of UCUG went to Slubfest in search of inspiration, and learned that Television performing live sounds like Verlaine is actively mocking his own vocals as he sings their drip dry ex-addict repetoire. \u00a0Incredible. \u00a0The Buzzcocks do not sound like that, but if they did it would be radz.<\/p>\n<p>Punch out your own jams!

You are about to hear and view material that was released by Kapotte Muziek in 1988. It was an anthology of works from the first three and half years of existence. A lifetime it seemed back then, a mere drop in time when I look back on it now. I compiled this tape in 1988 for the US branche of my label Korm Plastics, run by Jeff Surak, who was the driving force behind Destruktive Technologies Foundation.I went back to the archives of Kapotte Muziek and dug out some of the original artwork produced for some of these tracks. In those days your compilation cassette was not complete with a black and white xeroxed booklet. I either had some drawing or some text or some image. I also produced some postcards and in my na\u00efve youth I used skulls and pictures of naked women: things I wouldn't do now, or in a more thought-out context at least. You'll find these postcards and flyers in the mixed media part of the CD. The original cassette came with a booklet and I use the same linernotes here, but some slight alternation here and there. Here it goes... This anthology from Kapotte Muziek is covering up the first period of the existence of this group. Group? In the first years the group existed out of two people, whilst now there is only one, or better: we are all Kapotte Muziek. Kapotte Muziek started as the invention of Christian Nijs and Frans de Waard. The reason was not at all the urge to start a band but the necessity of making a track for a compilation done by Frans de Waard (being Katacombe Vol.3). After this track we decided to do some more, because Christian had a guitar, tapedeck and during a journey by train he had found a violin bow. This shows already we didn't had many instruments, never will have. We could always borrow things from friends. \"<\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"22","album_listens":"2470","album_date_created":"2\/17\/2010 04:44:14 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kapotte_Muziek_-_An_Apology_is_Necessary_-_20100217155216730.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"6601","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"5581","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kapotte_Muziek_-_An_Apology_is_Necessary_-_20100217155216730.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: An Apology is Necessary","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"19119","album_title":"An Appreciation","album_handle":"An_Appreciation","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/The_Music_of_Ancient_Greece\/An_Appreciation\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"The Music of Ancient Greece","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/The_Music_of_Ancient_Greece\/","album_producer":"Igor Jovanovic","album_engineer":"Jaan Patterson","album_information":"<p>\"\"The music of ancient Greece was almost universally present in society, from marriages and funerals to religious ceremonies, theatre, folk music and the ballad-like reciting of epic poetry.

To this day, many of my favorite Learning Music tracks come from these early records.\u00a0 After completing 12 albums, he took a break from the studio to focus on the live band.\u00a0 Learning Music hosted several monthly residencies at the now defunct Tangier in Los Feliz. These nights were always great fun as the controlled chaos of the 20+ person mega Learning Music band took the stage.\u00a0 John would write out marching-band style flip charts, and anyone that showed up was more than welcome to play or sing along.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">Later that summer, John and I were eating some tacos and I asked him if he'd consider recording a new album for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freemusicarchive.org\/label\/vosotros\">vosotros<\/a>. He paused for a second and asked, \"what if I recorded twelve?\". And just like that, Learning Music Monthly was born. We spent the rest of our lunch mapping out the basic details of a subscription series. The first iteration of LMM was a little over the top. For instance, our annual subscribers received a private song written for them on their birthday (one of which is included here as track 20!). But just as John's creative vision evolved, so did our distribution model. We experimented with a donation-based paywall for downloads - but after some reflection, it seemed counterintuitive to put any barriers to entry in place. In its current form, the band's entire catalog is licensed under Creative Commons and available for free stream & download at <a href=\"http:\/\/LearningMusicMonthly.com\">LearningMusicMonthly.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">For the last several years, John has driven over to my house each month with a new album in hand. \"I feel good about this one,\" he'd say. But now, after 3 seasons, 36 albums, and over 500 songs, Learning Music Monthly is coming to a close.\u00a0 One of my favorite bits of press came from a blog called <em>The World In A Paper Cup.<\/em> In describing the project, Emma wrote \"the only consistent thread is the high quality of intent and skill put into each piece\". I couldn't agree more. Anyone that knows or works with John knows how much care goes into his music - and after all those albums, his ethos has remained the same. The 50+ musicians that have eagerly donated their time and talent to LMM is a testament to this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">Putting together this compilation proved difficult for me. I started with a playlist of over 100 tracks and spent weeks slowly whittling it down and trying to arrange it in a way that made sense. I was eventually left with one song from each album - not necessarily all the \"hits\" - just a collection of personal favorites. They are loosely arranged into \"loud\" and \"soft\" with a brief intermission in between.\u00a0 The mix ends with \"Robot Anthem Part I and II\" - the first (of many) Learning Music songs that caused me to stare at my speakers in bemusement and excitement. My hope is that through the FMA, new listeners will continue to discover their own gems from this great catalog of music.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; font: 12px Helvetica;\">- John Gillilan<\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"1","album_favorites":"5","album_tracks":"37","album_listens":"54801","album_date_created":"4\/27\/2011 01:00:25 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Learning_Music_-_An_End_Like_This_-_2011042715154765.png","album_images":[{"image_id":"13601","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"9072","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Learning_Music_-_An_End_Like_This_-_2011042715154765.png","image_title":"Album Image: An End Like This","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"6050","album_title":"An Evening of Javanese Music and Dance","album_handle":"An_Evening_of_Javanese_Music_and_Dance","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gamelan_Nyai_Saraswati\/An_Evening_of_Javanese_Music_and_Dance\/","album_type":"Live Performance","artist_name":"Gamelan Nyai Saraswati","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gamelan_Nyai_Saraswati\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>An Evening of Javanese Music and Dance<br \/>April 26, 2009<br \/>Kenan Rehearsal Hall at<br \/>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br \/><br \/>The Gamelan Ensemble Nyai Saraswati is made up primarily of UNC students, but also includes community members and friends.

Here, in her first official and long awaited solo release, you will find a spectrum of somnambulist trances that seamlessly conjoin dense and frantic depth with delicate fracture.

His punkroots are still clearly present in his powerful voice, the themes are still slightly pagan. The difference with \"The Sky Falls, We Shall Catch Larks\" is the fact that on the new album we much more hear the product of a band, with profound arrangements and detailed production. \"An Interlude For The Outermost\" has become the masterpiece we all expected from Kiss The Anus Of A Black Cat. The recordings of \"An Interlude For The Outmost\" already started in August 2006, when Heeren, together with guitar player De Mar and drummer David Stubbe (ex-Thee Plague Of Gentlemen) took a room in art center Vooruit (Ghent) to record the basics of the new album. After that, Heeren started to reshape the songs by inviting different musicians to play different parts and by getting everything together on the computer. Thematically not much has changed. He still screams his soul into the mic. and carries all the shit of the world on his shoulders for the time the album lasts. Even though some melodies might prove the contrary, the feel of this album hasn't much to do with the joy of life. This young musician's main worries are both the heritage of 09\/11, the banality of the individual and society. This desillusion he tries to put into his lyrics and music. And how... With the rock line-up he has clearly found his thing, and presents us the new album that is definitely one of the highlights of the contemporary darkfolk movement.<\/p>\n<p><br \/><\/p>\n<p>-<a title=\"An Interlude to the Outermost at Kraak\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kraak.net\/en\/releases.php?ID=30\">Kraak<\/a><br \/><\/p>","album_date_released":"2\/27\/2007","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"546","album_date_created":"7\/08\/2009 10:54:17 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Kiss_the_Anus_of_a_Black_Cat_-_An_Interlude_To_The_Outermost_-_2009113012904862.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"32275","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Daniel_Barbiero_-_20151215114824398.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"8449","album_title":"An Interstate Pugulist","album_handle":"An_Interstate_Pugulist","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gyanism\/An_Interstate_Pugulist\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Gyanism","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Gyanism\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>From Brisbane\u2019s fertile underground flows a million glistening particles as the soundtrack to the dirge of our lives unravels our minds into a cathedral of crystal shards and wails our prayers into the void.

It ranges from the wonderfully relaxed and ambient to displays of abrasive noise, old school IDM, interestingly crafted rhythms that change over time and even hints of an advanced form of dubstep. At points the album somehow sounds almost tropical, before again sweeping you away in sharp noise and beat fuelled energy. <\/em><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em>Silent Strangers uses a great number of different sounds, capturing the imagination in different ways. Dans Kalimba in particular seems to take a refreshing break from the electronic by playing with the sampled, or the seemingly sampled, whichever the case may be. Imagined finger clicks hold the rhythm for a recurring and hypnotic ever changing noise like someone playing the engine of an aeroplane.<\/em><\/div>\n<p><em> Dark electronics and filtered synths sit with a digital percussion that plays with all the natural and organic qualities of human drumming. At times, in the background, distant sounds play out quieter melodies, creating a wonderful second layer that has to be concentrated on, listened out for, a whole other story of far off intrigue that sits behind the glitchy IDM. The way all these different components fit together so well, with great attention to composition, brilliant sound design and a fair few hints of mystery throughout, with a beautiful ambient opening and a beautiful ambient piece to close the album, makes this an essential listen.<\/em><\/p>","album_date_released":"9\/22\/2013","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"10","album_listens":"55126","album_date_created":"9\/22\/2013 11:06:39 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Silent_Strangers_-_Anagram3_Adrift_-_20130922113450765.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"24937","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"15093","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Silent_Strangers_-_Anagram3_Adrift_-_20130922113450765.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Anagram3: Adrift","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":["silent strangers","electronic glitch idm experimental section 27","anagram3","experimental"]},{"album_id":"19360","album_title":"Anagrams","album_handle":"Anagrams","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/The_Womb\/Anagrams\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"The Womb","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/The_Womb\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":null,"album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"1","album_tracks":"11","album_listens":"1727","album_date_created":"11\/25\/2015 02:58:16 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/The_Womb_-_Anagrams_-_2015112524203160.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"32044","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"19360","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/The_Womb_-_Anagrams_-_2015112524203160.jpg","image_title":"Album Image: Anagrams","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"19099","album_title":"Anaheim: Rarities","album_handle":"Anaheim_Rarities","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Steve_Combs\/Anaheim_Rarities\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Steve Combs","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Steve_Combs\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Songs you've probably never heard before unless you're hardcore.

If awesomeness was able to ride a bike, Tracky B would have to brake uphill!<br \/><br \/>It took forever until he finally released a solo album, while 'solo' doesn't mean Tracky missed the opportunity to have his <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">friends<\/span> join in too:<br \/><br \/>\"<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Hasi International\u2122<\/span> and I had so much fun writing the low-brow lyrics and recording them at 3a.m. for the Intro, but after re-listening the next morning we were kinda shocked. I made <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Rosie<\/span> sing over it, but I still feel like getting dumber every time I listen to it. I can feel my braincells die.<br \/>We also recorded Hasi's message for Obligatory Answering Machine Skit that night, which also contains a short sample my buddy <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Seecoy<\/span> sent me.<br \/><br \/>Free Dschimi is a tribute to my idols <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Martin Denny<\/span> and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Arthur Lyman<\/span>; check my self-made bird cries and the de-tuned ukulele in the end!<br \/><br \/>For WuBatman-Tang I borrowed an accordion from Hasi's dad. Special thanks to <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Pierlo<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Konrad<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Roglok<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Vernon<\/span>, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Isocore<\/span>, and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Cindy Sizer<\/span> for the gipsy-\"hey\" in the end! Enter the WuBatman, whigger.<br \/><br \/>The middle part of Balla! features all voices my <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Yamaha keyboard<\/span> PSS-390 has in the instruments bank. My song should be on its \"Demo\" button!<br \/><br \/>Last year <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">M-Boy<\/span> and I invited our friend <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Andr\u00e9 Herzer<\/span> to play a fat bassline and some guitar for us to be used in a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">new Discoghosts track<\/span>. I finally finished the song while M-Boy is somewhere in India or Vietnam, on his world trip..<br \/>The second part of the song is something we had dismissed, but I thought it actually fits. I wanted to keep you from forgetting about the geists!<br \/>The title, E\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6hh! is what <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">soccer fans<\/span> yell, trying to immitate those <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">air horns<\/span>. We've been using that exclamation at parties or as a greeting since the <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">World Cup 2006<\/span> in Germany...<br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Roglok<\/span> once sent me a loop and said \"here, I can't use it\"; I secretly passed it on to <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Vernon LeNoir<\/span> who remixed and returned it as \"Roglok's Journey to the Belly-Button of the World\". I quickly added some <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">scratches<\/span> and <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">crappy raps<\/span>, and it became the closer for my album and is now simply called Good Bye. First time Roglok hears what we did to his loop!<br \/><br \/>Track #10 is a beat <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Dragan Espenschied<\/span> of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Bodenst\u00e4ndig 2000<\/span> made for me; I used the opportunity to express my <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">love for the internets<\/span>. The sample \"F\u00fcr Mich Seid Ihr Alles Raver\" by German wanna-be bad boy rapper <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Bushido<\/span> means \"you're all ravers to me\", as if ravers were something bad. Needless to mention that drx proves him wrong! <br \/><br \/>The last song I recorded was Overdosie Rosie, an early <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">Christmas gift<\/span> for my wife.

After months of preparation, yearly regional compilation - Balkan Under The Radar, under the auspices of the Black Planet Records lived to have its third edition. Since they have already solidified the label\u2019s sound and its residents, the Black Planet team presents us with the Antisocial Network. Compilations \"Balkan Under The Radar\" are aimed at discovering interesting names mainly from Serbia, but also from other countries from ex-Yugoslavia, with of course our residents and friends. We managed to unify underground from almost all of the former Yugoslav republics. Most of the stuff was brewed especially for this compilation, all of which were previously unreleased. This time compilation consists of three parts with 40 songs by artists from around the region. The first part is dedicated to the music-playing and electronic alternative projects with vocals. The second part is devoted to experimental instrumental music, hip hop and electronica. Third part is the most experimental and least pleasant to the listeners including noise and experimental. <br \/> Concerning the genres - this time too it's a wide range - alternative, post-rock, new \/ dark wave, hc punk, grunge, electronics, industrial, ambient, noise, avant garde, jazz, bass music, hip hop, noise, experimental, etc. <br \/> Artwork \u017divko Kondi\u0107 <br \/> <br \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artstation.com\/artist\/zhille\">www.artstation.com\/artist\/zhille<\/a> <br \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/zhillustrator\">www.facebook.com\/zhillustrator<\/a> <br \/> <br \/> <br \/> Enjoy and share with others. :) <br \/> With love, <br \/> BPR HQ<\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"42","album_listens":"13469","album_date_created":"7\/19\/2016 02:56:53 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Balkan_Under_The_Radar_vol4_-_Antisocial_Network_-_20160719184921427.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"31907","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Astrometrics_-_20151109165009439.jpg","image_title":"Artist Image: Astrometrics","image_caption":"Astrometrics","image_copyright":"Astrometrics","image_source":null}],"tags":["darkwave","triphop","alternative","avant-garde experimental"]},{"album_id":"20931","album_title":"Antiteleolog\u00eda","album_handle":"Antiteleologa","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/hhhnihhh\/Antiteleologa\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"hhhnihhh","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/hhhnihhh\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p><strong>hhhnihhh<\/strong> from Chile is a very active member of the <strong>South American noise <\/strong>and<strong> experimental scene<\/strong> and whilst <strong>Antiteleolog\u00eda<\/strong> sounds like some ethnographic field recordings from a seventh continent it's the <strong>second<\/strong> of the<strong> Industria Tropical series of eps<\/strong> by artists who published on the <a href=\"https:\/\/pakapirecords.bandcamp.com\/album\/va-industria-tropical\" target=\"_blank\">Industria Tropical compilation<\/a>. <strong>Antiteleolog\u00eda<\/strong> crackles and hisses from enigmatic chants, dusty drum machines and discarded devices.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>released June 20, 2016\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Artwork:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a92016 Felipe Villar\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a92016 Pakapi Records\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a92016 hhhnihhh\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a92016 Pakapi Records<\/p>","album_date_released":"6\/20\/2016","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"5","album_listens":"3408","album_date_created":"6\/20\/2016 08:08:40 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/hhhnihhh_-_Antiteleologa_-_20160620221346183.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"34498","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"20931","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/hhhnihhh_-_Antiteleologa_-_20160620221346183.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":null,"image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"20940","album_title":"Antiwo","album_handle":"Antiwo","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Colectivo_Etreo\/Antiwo\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Colectivo Et\u00e9reo","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Colectivo_Etreo\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<div style=\"color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;\">\n<div>1) Textra\u00f1o<\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>M\u00fasica: Menda.

Now based in Berlin, where he is active as a visual artist and as a composer. \u00a0His music is based on his own vocabulary of pulse and self-designed instrumentation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.8; vertical-align: baseline; color: #5f5f5f;\">The North Carolina by way of Wisconsin trio Megafaun (comprised of brothers Brad and Phil Cook and Joe Westerlund) has been working since 1997, when the three met at the H.O.R.D.E. festival. After a decade of crafting their sound, Westerlund contacted Jeff Hunt, owner of the Table of the Elements label, looking to get in touch with Dreyblatt, whose work all three admired. The following year they were able to schedule a week long residency at Salem Art Works in the mountains of upstate New York, where Dreyblatt taught them the just intonation tuning system he\u2019d developed as well as some of the instruments he\u2019d devised. They presented Dreyblatt\u2019s compositions at the 2008 Wire Festival in Chicago and concerts in Boston and NYC.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.8; vertical-align: baseline; color: #5f5f5f;\">Busy schedules kept them from working together again until the 2012 Hopscotch Music Festival in Raleigh, North Carolina, just a stretch of mountains south from where they\u2019d developed their joint sound. Excited about the performance, they booked the Pinebox Recording studio in Graham, N.C. to lay down the tracks that make up\u00a0Appalachian Excitation. They connected again last February to play the Ecstatic Music Festival in New York City.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.8; vertical-align: baseline; color: #5f5f5f;\">The album was recorded live in the studio with no click track and minimal separation, a new experience for the men of Megafaun. It\u2019s \u201cthe most rewarding way to record,\u201d said Joe Westerlund. \u201cThis record with Arnold marks a step towards Megafaun becoming more of a live-in-the-studio recording band, a more traditional and time-tested method.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.8; vertical-align: baseline; color: #5f5f5f;\">Speaking from the stage at Merkin Concert Hall during their Ecstatic Music appearance last year, Dreyblatt said such genre transcending collaborations wouldn\u2019t have been possible several decades ago. \u201cWe are no longer one-dimensional people,\u201d he announced. Experience the dimensions of Appalachian groove and time-honored minimalism anew with Dreyblatt and Megafaun.<\/p>\n<\/div>","album_date_released":"9\/17\/2015","album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"678","album_date_created":"3\/09\/2015 12:35:54 PM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Arnold_Dreyblatt__Megafaun_-_Appalachian_Excitation_-_20150309124514890.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"26185","image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/artists\/Olivia_Chaney_-_20140109183821366.jpg","image_title":"artists Image","image_caption":"Photo: Patrick Williams","image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.oliviachaney.net\/photos"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"5610","album_title":"Apparat - Live @ KEXP 12\/30\/2009","album_handle":"Apparat_-_Live__KEXP_12302009","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Apparat_1089\/Apparat_-_Live__KEXP_12302009\/","album_type":"Live Performance","artist_name":"Apparat","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Apparat_1089\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Berlin electronic producer Sasha Ring (Apparat) drops this dreamy set\nof techno and dubstep flavored beats live on KEXP.\u00a0 Featuring material\nspanning his catalog (including collaborations with Ellen Alien and\nModeselektor) this solo laptop performance sounds just as good on the\nheadphones as it will on your boombox. - <a title=\"Listen to full set\" href=\"http:\/\/kexp.org\/live\/liveperformance.aspx?rID=30810\">M.

More intimate and spacious than the Tunnel\u2019s previous record, \u201cSultry Daggers,\u201d \u201cApparition Overdrive\u201d was written collectively by two new collaborators, drummer Jon Weiss (Jello Biafra, Helios Creed, Horsey) and Rowland S Howard-esque guitarist Gregory James, along with the returning Sam Black (bass\/electronics) and Jeff Wagner (vocals\/guitar).

tom\u00e1s gris. ghe first recordings were improvisations for alto sax and drum. over twelve years txema and tom\u00e1s have been playing together when they can (their lives took different paths). now, txema lives with his family (monica and little noe) in the middle of the field, near the forest, the river, the mountains in asturias (north of spain). this recording was done there.<\/p>\n<p>the concepts that guided the \u201colatunji project\u201d are ritual and improvisation. these concepts are the basis for a dialogue between the musicians (primarily as very good friends) and a dialogue with the environment, always the field and its elements (animals, wind, water, fire, rocks\u2026.). in short, this is an experience of love and friendship through the sound in its most extensive range.<\/p>\n<p>in this recording you can hear the sound of the various percussion instruments (tablas, panderos, cymbals, etc); various wind instruments (alto sax, flutes, voice, etc.); and, with equal importance, the sound of the environment \u2013 the company of monica, cristina and noe (sometimes spontaneously playing additional percussion); the wind, the river, the bonfire and the wood burning and creaking; the dogs, the rain\u2026<\/p>\n<p>this recording illustrates all the experience that seeks to live and share this sound project halfway between improvisation and the ancient rituals.<\/p>\n<p>music by:<br \/> txema fernandes \u2013 percussion, voice, flute<br \/> tom\u00e1s gris \u2013 alto sax, voice, percussion<br \/> percussion and company \u2013 cristina, monica and

recording apparatus, the Tascam 424 4-track cassette recorder.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I started recording solo sessions and impromptu jams with friends.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Before I had a drum kit at my disposal, I used to make \u2018mock drum kits\u2019 with pots and pans, stretched canvas and glass.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I would buy these Junkers at Salvation Army or commandeer old glass bowls from around the house; kind of like a little kids marching band set up.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I would cover the pot and its lid with a towel so the lid would shake and create \u201cdecay\u201d, like a snare drum, but muted so it wouldn\u2019t sound too \u201ctinny\u201d.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>The towel would also help keep it in place.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I used a stretched canvas, a painting of my sisters, for a bass drum and usually draped it over a pair of sneakers, then prop a microphone underneath it.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I would use a loose bass drum mallet for the canvas and sticks or brushes for the others.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I think buckets, card board boxes and guitar cases were also employed.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Most of these recordings were to familiarize myself with recording, pass the time and exercise my improve skills.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I would rarely rehearse a bit before doing an overdub as I just didn\u2019t have the patience, plus I was so used to just \u201cGoing\u201d once the tape was rolling. <span>\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>Recording solo also gave me the opportunity to experiment with guitar sounds and pedal combinations; Wha Wha all the way UP in the high range and Octave pedal in the low range creating this wall of sound devoid of any discernible tuning; octaves and frequencies would clash and phase off each other at the same time, messy headphone fun. I never distributed these recordings on a cassette releases, only the Joe Bob Briggs theme every made it out of the house.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I just played them for close friends and band mates. Some became favorites around Severed Lips HQ; digging the quirky fuzzy production or my awkward early attempts at singing.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>A few tracks were reworked for Dynomite Cat, King Ghidorah and Armageddon Gospel.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jellied Eyes<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ruby (dynamite cat) and I sing in this fantasy stroll in the wood that leads to the discovery of a dead girl and a naive discussion of mortality. Pots \u2018n\u2019 pan dums, maybe a cardboard box too. One of my Wha Wha pedals broke and turned into an overdriven volume pedal which I continued to use for that added boost.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This song was one of the early Dynomite Cat songs and may have been played at a Christmas party with Ruby on bass and vocals and myself, guitar and vocals.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">High Octeen<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Solo Hellfire experimentation featuring pot's n pans drums. Chorus from a variable Morley chorus\/delay pedal used once on the percussion and next on the vocals.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Inspired by a lifelong love affair with THE CRAMPS.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thief (king Ghidorah)<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">4tk experimentation and creation of the song 'THIEF' later recorded with a full band, KING GHIDORAH! for the 'Primateen Mist Kills Super Models' Compilation (also featured on KG Long Pig compilation). Pots and pans from Salvation Army mixed with a towel covered glass bowl as the \u201chigh end\u201d percussion instruments. A stretched canvas laid out over a pair of sneakers with a radio shack microphone underneath it as the bass drum.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Overdubbed with Bass, guitars a little key board and scratchy vocals through some distortion Boss stomp box I can't remember. <span>\u00a0<\/span>Before reworking with king Ghidorah!, I found that I had forgotten the lyrics and was having trouble deciphering the garbled mess, as I had made them up in one take years ago.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>Mikey Ovum said that he \u2018knew\u2019 the lyrics having listened to the song over and over and deciphering his own version of the song.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>What started as a \u201ccradle robber\u2019s\u201d warning became the yelping\u2019s of a GRAVE robber who would steal your bones and even your headstone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Don\u2019t Inhale<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pot\u2019s \u2018n\u2019 pans plus bucket and backward guitar meanderings.

Witnessing and imaginary murder while smoking a cigarette in the broom closet.<span>\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Auto Erotic<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Death by auto erotic asphyxiation was a topical subject, having articles in newspapers and porn magazines alike.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>A great way for someone you didn\u2019t like to be found dead.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>I had a few of these people on my list.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This song was actually written years before and was to be reworked at the very first Disco Missile recording session in 1992 however Eddie and Todd popped a tab of LSD in my mouth before we could even set up sending the session in an alternate direction\u2026thankfully.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thunder \u2018n\u2019 Lightnin\u2019<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the first songs I recorded with my new 4-track.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>All guitars, big muff and boss chorus plus Gorilla practice amp reverb shaken not stirred.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>A tribute to interstellar Astor Projection, Clockwork Orange soundtrack and Devo.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Break Night instrumental<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This may be the very first recording done with my 4-tracks.<span>\u00a0 <\/span>A cute improved psyche guitar jingle.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SLR 1995<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With SGB instrumental<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">and<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mouth In the Wrong place<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both tracks recorded with Frankie Norton, Mike Brenan, Scott G Beattie and William Hellfire.

The range of these works is tremendous: From harsh intensity to gorgeous drone to virtual silence, concluding with the deeply affecting title track.Monosov recorded three of the six pieces presented here as solo works, while the other half are collaborations. Two of these collaborative tracks feature conceptual sound artist Civyiu Kkliu (Banned Productions) and the third includes the work of veteran electronic composer Larry Polansky (Frog Peak). Architectures on Air and Other Works displays the fruits of several years' worth of activity, and though each piece is distinct in concept and execution, the album offers a solid block of organic sound, compelling from beginning to end. In addition to the stunning audio work, this enhanced CD also features two QuickTime movie files of Monosov's sound performances (about 18 minutes of material).  <\/p><p> -Elevator Bath, Ilya Monosov, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elevatorbath.com\/eeaoa022.html\">Architectures<\/a><br \/><\/p>","album_date_released":null,"album_comments":"0","album_favorites":"0","album_tracks":"1","album_listens":"939","album_date_created":"8\/03\/2009 10:44:09 AM","album_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ilya_Monosov_-_Architectures_On_Air_and_Other_Works_-_2009113012724753.jpg","album_images":[{"image_id":"3913","user_id":null,"artist_id":null,"album_id":"4021","curator_id":null,"image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/albums\/Ilya_Monosov_-_Architectures_On_Air_and_Other_Works_-_2009113012724753.jpg","image_title":"albums Image","image_caption":null,"image_copyright":null,"image_source":"http:\/\/www.elevatorbath.com\/eeaoa022.jpg","image_order":"0"}],"tags":[]},{"album_id":"14040","album_title":"Archives 2","album_handle":"Archives_2","album_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Pornophonik\/Archives_2\/","album_type":"Album","artist_name":"Pornophonik","artist_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/music\/Pornophonik\/","album_producer":null,"album_engineer":null,"album_information":"<p>Pornophonik is back with his unique style, something around IDM with natural sounds, you can call it 'Toytronica'...\/...
