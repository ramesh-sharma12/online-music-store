It is currently the longest running <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/freeform.html\">freeform<\/a> radio station in the United States. <br \/><br \/> The station also broadcasts to the Hudson Valley and Lower Catskills in New York, Western New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania via its 90.1 signal at WXHD in Mount Hope, NY. The station maintains an extensive online presence at WFMU.ORG which includes live audio streaming in several formats, over 8 years of audio archives, podcasts and a popular blog.<br \/><br \/> Rolling Stone Magazine, The Village Voice, CMJ and the New York Press have all at one time or another called WFMU \"the best radio station in the country\" and the station has also been the subject of feature stories in <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/nytimes.html\">The New York Times<\/a> and on the BBC. In recent years the station has gained a large <a href=\"http:\/\/wfmu.org\/marathon\/map.php\">international following<\/a> due to its online operations and counts Simpson's creator Matt Groening, film director Jim Jarmusch and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed, among others, as devoted fans of the station. <br \/><br \/> WFMU's programming ranges from flat-out uncategorizable strangeness to rock and roll, experimental music, 78 RPM Records, jazz, psychedelia, hip-hop, electronica, hand-cranked wax cylinders, punk rock, gospel, exotica, R&B, radio improvisation, cooking instructions, classic radio airchecks, found sound, dopey call-in shows, interviews with obscure radio personalities and notable science-world luminaries, spoken word collages, Andrew Lloyd Webber soundtracks in languages other than English as well as Country and western music.<br \/><br \/> All of the station's programming is controlled by individual DJs and is not beholden to any type of station-wide playlist or rotation schedule. Experimentation, spontaneity and humor are among the station's most frequently noted distinguishing traits. WFMU does not belong to any existing public radio network, and close to 100% of its programming originates at the station.<\/p>","curator_favorites":"732","curator_comments":"25","curator_playlists":"17","curator_date_created":"12\/03\/2008 07:23:15 AM"},{"curator_id":"1119","curator_handle":"Video","curator_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/Video\/","curator_site_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/video","curator_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/curators\/Music_for_Video_-_20150515124516930.jpg","curator_type":"curator","curator_title":"Music for Video","curator_tagline":null,"curator_bio":"<p>The Music for Video portal seeks to\u00a0fill a void in music for online media projects by\u00a0featuring artists who wish to participate in the open sharing of their works under the <a title=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/about\/licenses\" href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/about\/licenses\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons licensing framework<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We regularly feature Creative Commons music mixes curated with the producer in mind, as well as resources for education about <a title=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/legalmusicforvideos\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/legalmusicforvideos\" target=\"_blank\">Legal Music for Video<\/a>\u00a0and <a title=\"http:\/\/www.centerforsocialmedia.org\/fair-use\/best-practices\/online-video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.centerforsocialmedia.org\/fair-use\/best-practices\/online-video\" target=\"_blank\">Best Practices in Online Video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you're new to the Free Music Archive and these concepts, please read our <a title=\"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/faq\" href=\"\/faq\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ<\/a>.<\/p>","curator_favorites":"550","curator_comments":"58","curator_playlists":"9","curator_date_created":"9\/13\/2011 12:42:22 PM"},{"curator_id":"99","curator_handle":"Music_from_the_Isabella_Stewar","curator_url":"http:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/curator\/Music_from_the_Isabella_Stewar\/","curator_site_url":"http:\/\/www.gardnermuseum.org\/music\/music_at_the_gardner","curator_image_file":"https:\/\/freemusicarchive.org\/file\/images\/curators\/Music_from_the_Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_Boston_-_20130214163717546.jpg","curator_type":"curator","curator_title":"Music from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston","curator_tagline":"Music from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston","curator_bio":"<p><span class=\"bodytext\">Located in the Fenway area of Boston, <a title=\"http:\/\/gardnermuseum.org\/\" href=\"http:\/\/gardnermuseum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum<\/a>\u00a0is home to the nation's longest-running museum music program.

However, a cover and a tracklisting is provided in order for you to burn them to disc, if you'd like.<\/p>\n<p>Why do we do what we do? We love music, we love netaudio and have found that the quality and variety of what\u2019s coming out of this culture is superior to that of much of what\u2019s coming out of the mainstream music industry. We feel more secure donating to netaudio artists\/labels then we do purchasing formulaic music-product from the majors. We\u2019d like you to also feel that way toward the netaudio culture. We realize that most people don\u2019t have the time and\/or patience to filter through it all to find the good stuff, so we invest the time to find the gems in the ruff and deliver them to you in our releases.<\/p>\n<p>In between releases, you can also look forward to blog posts about netaudio news or topics relating to DRM and online music.<\/p>\n<p>So subscribe to our\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blocsonic.com\/feed\">feed<\/a>\u00a0and discover great new openly-licensed music every month.
